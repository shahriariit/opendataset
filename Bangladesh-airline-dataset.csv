"I naver used Biman Bangladesh and it was first time I tried and what can I say about biman, best airline in the world, I had sooo many bad feedback about biman and I think biman changed everything to do well and give fantastic service. I would definitely recommend people to use biman . I would say to Sylheti people please use biman Bangladesh so we get amazing service all the time.",Positive,Fantastic food and service,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
I have travelled from London to Dhaka direct flight due to COVID and it was my first time I have experienced Bangladesh biman and definitely my last time . While sending my luggage the staffs on the gate harassed me I felt because I had enough allowance and I only had a small bag hand where I hardy had anything so they could allow 2 kilo more in my luggage rather than asking for extra money (staffs are irrelevant ) and then making me open my luggage thousand times . Also the gate flight supervisor a lady at London Heathrow airport terminal 2 was very rude she didnâ€™t even listen what I was gonna say instead she said just to save your time u have pay extra this and that like she didnâ€™t even try to listen what I was trying to say . Very disappointing she had no manner how to behave and talk to passengers and she is a supervisor like what ... the cabin crew were well behaved but you can hardly find cabin crew during quiet time as they are always in their station but they were well behaved. Just didnâ€™t like the gate staffs specially the lady supervisor of that wasnâ€™t uk I would have slapped her for that behaviour like we pay for service and want to get that service we do not travel for free or with their fathers money . Also the food during the flight came very late for awhile I wanted to jump out of the plane because I was starving ... they need to give food on time . More Improvement needed and staffs need more training and definitely should not hire staffs who doesnâ€™t know how to behave with passengers . I felt it because I am a tourism and hospitality employee at a fairmont hotel in London and I have trained air hostesses at from Saudi airlines do I know how passengers should be treated . Pleas give more training to customer service staffs at the airport thanks . For me ... never travelling from bd biman worst behaved at the luggage desk ... staffs are always gossiping ... poor service at the luggage desk... also the cabin crews are not very attentive they forgot to give me my food and they did not re check if all passengers got food I had to call someone to give me food ...,Negative,Rude flight supervisor at the airport desk,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
Do not fly with this stupid airlines itâ€™s too dirty inside and the sit service I will never fly agen,Negative,Very bad,US_Bangla_Airlines
From the minute I stepped into the airport the staff assisted with my baggage and security scanning until I was handed my boarding pass to board the plane. Highly recommended.,Positive,Great customer service !,US_Bangla_Airlines
"The worst airlines, run by irresponsible, and stupid people. They have no sense of time and service. If you ask any assistance, whether they don't know they answer, they will give you even terrible suggestions which will make your life real hell and finally you will realize their suggestion was unnecessary. I had no other option that's why I needed to fly with them and I wish I never again fall in such situation. Their behave is such rude and inappropriate to let you think they are actually inhuman and monsters.",Negative,Overall review of US Bangla Airlines,US_Bangla_Airlines
"Flights that I find comfortable, strange, panic, and angry. The circumstances are mixed together. The plane is ready for boarding but there are still many passengers making phone or video calls, even though flight attendants have banned cellphones. And this might disrupt the aircraft's navigation system.",Mixed,Domestic flights in Bangladesh,US_Bangla_Airlines
Had travelled from Dhaka to Chittagong in US Bangla airlines. Initially I had some fear as only recently they had a crash in Nepal. What I observed is that their check in and boarding process was very fast and on time. Aircraft was clean and efficient staff.,Positive,Efficient service,US_Bangla_Airlines
"I heard about this airline so I called them. Twice they hung up on me. I guess you're only allowed to ask one question. Well they just saved me from flying with an unprofessional company. So thanks. I will never fly this airline. I did not fly with them. However, they would not allow me to write a review without stating a flight.Just plan rude.",Negative,Officer,Regent_Airways
Flight size and type is better than any other domestic airlines of Bangladesh. Service is good. I will say professional. They don't have flight in all the domestic routes. But they seem to be the best in Bangladesh.Food may be improved.,Positive,Family trip,Regent_Airways
"I did not know about this airline till the travel date and the ticket was arranged by my office. But I was pleasantly surprised by their services, the speed at which boarding was completed, luggages delivered or punctuality. The flight was actually coming from Muscat to Dhaka via Chattogram.Will surely recommend. Cheap fair and a Boeing 737. It was a good deal as well.",Positive,"An unknown airline for me, but got superb experience",Regent_Airways
"PROS: good flight schedule, comprehensive online booking interface, serve a snack on the flight no matter how short.CONS: Flights often leave 20+ min late, plane interiors are FILTHY.",Mixed,Bus with wings - which is fine for a 30-min flight,Regent_Airways

In this pandemic situation just eleventh hour you guys notifying that flight will be delayed 1 hour. BAS*****!!Â Toder mamar bari ai desh ta. Kuttar bacchar dhol.,Negative,VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED!!,NOVOAIR
"This is my latest experience since Novoair change their logo pattern and inclusion of new aircrafts. Although I was not very pleased with my previous experience but this time it was like wind of change despite COVID situation. The flight was clean, new booking system was close to perfect and the cabin crew was very cordial and professional so was the expert pilot. It was really a comfortable flight experience.",Positive,Relatively comfy flight experience...,NOVOAIR
"Tried to pay online several times for a booking. Their online Card payment gateway seems to be broken; it goes blank right after submitting the OTP. I've tried from Chrome, Edge and Explorer browsers, so it can't be a browser issue. And to get help, I've called their helpline innumerable times and tried connecting to an operator; but every-time they disconnect after keeping the line engaged for a while. So on top of poor payment gateway, their customer service brings full circle to a terrible experience. I deduce they are flush with business, otherwise who would jeopardize the future of their business with such pathetic service.",Negative,Terrible payment gateway and even worse Customer Service,NOVOAIR
It was really a great experience for me to visit by NOVOAIR. I really enjoyed and it was excellent :D,Positive,my experience,NOVOAIR
It was one of longest domestic return flight from dhaka. One of the safest track record in the airline business in Bangladesh. Took the last flight both way. Takes about 45 minutes to reach. Neat and clean. Well trained and professional cabin crew. Serves refreshment on the flight.,Positive,One Of The Premium Airlines In Bangladesh,NOVOAIR

"When me and my husband went to airport for Biman to travel to Kualalumpur from Dhaka, we heard that the plane has left , we were there before 2 hours of the flying time. So we wanted to talk to somebody about what to do, but nobody was there, so I called a friend who was an employee of Biman ( Lawyer) , as she heard my problem, she started misbehaving and shouting with ill manner. We were just confused about what to do, then my husband talked to a man in the airport and that man managed the Malaysian airline to take us to KL.. Again, on the Biman after a year while travelling from KL to Dhaka our suitcase was cut and important and expensive things were stolen. Everytime the AC in the flight does not work, the cabin crew behave strange, the food is below quality. Not only the flight, the airport is also filthy with strange smell and unwanted people, the floor of the Dhaka airport is like a bus station of old days.",Negative,flown away leaving us.,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

Really enjoyed the flight.The staff were friendly. The flights on time..a bit early I think...fantastic!,Positive,Excellent food and flight,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"I was just wondering whats the point of submitting feedback to Biman and its authority since this may not go any further and on the other hand do they even do anything with the feedback that they receive. Despite all my views and thoughts I still believe it is my duty to share my disappointment and disturbance that it caused me and my family through this recent flight/journey with Biman through this feedback process. Worse come to worse I will raise this with Aviation Authority if needed. I would like Biman management to understand that passengers won't waste time and effort without a valid reason to do so, surely everyone has better things to do in life. It upsets me and loads of others like myself is that you get treated like animals from your own people despite spending the extortionate amount of money to travel with Biman, clearly Biman being monopoly player serving direct flight to Sylhet and taking advantage of all Sylhety travelers. Coming to my main feedback from my recent flight from Sylhet to Dhaka and then Dhaka to London Heathrow on 16/01/20 and then on 17/01/20. As usual the flight was delayed first by half an hour then by 1 hour and 25 minutes from Sylhet to Dhaka flight. From Dhaka airport to the hotel for overnight stay was unbearable experience. I had to wait outside the airport for almost an hour with my kids for bus/car where we were bitten by mosquitoes, dehydrated, hungry and really vulnerable. Where hotel representative kept on saying to us that the bus will be here within next 10 minutes even though we had to wait for almost an hour. But all of us were thinking that some how we need to get to the hotel where we all have a good rest and freshenup  Eventually, when we reached the hotel ""Hotel Platinum, in Uttara"" unfolded our biggest surprise. The room that was allocated to 6 of us seemed like staff quarters, dirty, blankets had blood spots on and a smelly bathroom. My kids could not sleep because of bed bugs and mosquitoes (I have taken pictures of all as evidence). As we were all hungry, first thing I've asked is that when would the dinner be served and if I can see the owner or the hotel manager. This is to raise my concern which I did later on  In terms of dinners/servings, this was very limited amount of food, only rice, chicken curry, dall and vegetable bhaji. Clearly not a lot on offer and clearly it felt that we were forcing the attendants for after meal tea refreshment which came at a cost of 50 Taka for 4 cups On the day flight we have been escorted out of the room 2 hours early and had to wait in the lobby Flight attendants from Dhaka to London Heathrow were rude and felt like that they do not have any manners, clearly treating us like a mole. One point when they were serving drinks where I had 2 of my kids were sitting beside me where I was asking them what drink were they having because they taking latterly more 20-25 seconds but we were told to hurry up and this point I said WHAT! and the respond I get was that they have other passengers to serve which I totally get but for GOD SAKE! They are kids. I'm sure they won't treat their kids like that. On the other hand they don't even ask what we were going to have as a meal instead they were forcing chicken curry and rice which we did not prefer. Clearly their seems to be a language barrier which I get but they do not pose any manners let alone they would have customer service knowledge In the best interest of Biman's success and reputation, hope something is being done",Negative,Bad experience with Biman,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"Very poor service. I wouldnâ€™t recommend Bangladesh Biman to anyone after what happened to us. Was made to sit in our seats with someoneâ€™s poo in the aisle covered with a newspaper sheet as the staff werenâ€™t mothered you clean it. This then spread along the entire aisle as people were stepping on it and moving it everywhere with their feet. Plus when you press the bell for them to come, they ignore it and you have to get up and go and get them. Disgusting service! Not forgetting to mention the hotel that they made us stay at in Dhaka as our flight was the next day. The hotel called White Rose was dirty, hair all over the bedcovers, floor looked like it hadnâ€™t been sweeped for days and the fan switch wouldnâ€™t work so we were stuck with our three children including our 6 month baby with a fan that went at full speed and wouldnâ€™t turn down. When we tried to turn it off, the mosquitoes were biting the heâ€™ll out of us. They only spray aerosol so they didnâ€™t even have solutions for this other than that!",Negative,Worst experience ever!,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
Excellent service. Crew services are very helpful. Fare is very reasonable. Departed in time and reached its destination in over 10 hours.,Positive,Dreamliner Boeing 787,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
The flight is long at around 10 hours and there always seems to be a delay on the return leg (triangular flight coming via Dhaka). The flight attendants are generally helpful and polite and the standard of the planes are reasonable. Would be ideal if there was a direct flight from Newcastle for passengers traveling from the north east of England. Overall not a bad experience and would probably choose this flight option again.,Positive,Direct Flight from Manchester to Sylhet,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"One of the worst in flight service.Very unfriendly crews,no smile,no greetings.Overall very poor service.Inside was full of mosquitos.",Negative,In-flight Service,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
The whole experience with Biman on their new service from Manchester direct to Sylhet was exceptional to say the least. I was very pleased and impressed with the cabin crew who delivered a great service throughout the entire journey. The aircraft was new and the journey time of 9 hours was bearable and enjoyable. Great food was served with a chicken curry once we were settled in. We had breakfast just before we landed. This is a great opportunity for Biman to impress which will keep people flying this convenient direct route to Sylhet for us who live in the north. Keep it up Biman!,Positive,Trip report with Biman 787-9,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
Excellent service very comfortable all round was very enjoyable will travel with Biman Bangladesh airlines again!,Positive,Excellent,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"I regularly fly business class on Emirates, BA, Etihad and Turkish AirlinesThis was every bit as good. The plane was probably the newest plane Iâ€™ve ever been on. Brand new 787. I couldnâ€™t find a mark or a scuff. The seat was full lie flat and the layout was better than my recent flight with BA from LHR to Islamabad. The screen size was good. The food from LHR was amongst the best Iâ€™ve had. Succulent lamb shank with boiled potatoes. Just perfect. Return flight food was far less impressive and they have a problem with mosquitos on the return flight (same problem last year)Considering where Biman ranks in international airlines, I couldnâ€™t really fault it except to say their on board entertainment is poor. The choice of films is very limited although I did find one or two decent ones in the end.",Positive,You won’t believe it!!,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
This airlines does not maintain time. Even if they change flight times they never inform passengers. On the other hand pilots are extremely skilled. You wil hardly feel an aircraft landing!,Mixed,Extremely poor timing,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"I went Bangladesh for 1 month from London Heathrow to Sylhet. One thing Biman needs to improve on is to have more direct flights especially from Sylhet to London Heathrow because I had to go to Dhaka and stay there overnight at a disgusting hotel. Anyways I survived there and then it was my long-haul flight from Dhaka to London Heathrow (11 hours). We took the new Biman 787-9 which was really good. The seats were very comfortable and the windows now have tints instead of the previous window shades. One problem was that because it was a new plane, they didnâ€™t set the IFE screen which meant there was no flight entertainment which was was a shame since it was a morning flight and everyone was awake. However they still operate a flight live map which will satisfy me but definitely not the kids. Our plane was delayed by 2 hours which i don't really mind but however the kids... I landed in London in the will of Allah but I still did enjoy the flight. If they set everything up then the flight would've been a much more pleasant experience.",Mixed,My Biman 787-9 experience,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"I have to say the last time i travelled with Biman was in 2004 so after 16 years, I was brave enough to try again. Travelled business class on one of the new aircrafts and it was just an amazing experience. Very comfy, clean, service was excellent and the food was delicious. The entertainment package could have been better as itâ€™s had old and small selection of movies. No WiFi on board.I heard the economy seats are very cramped, food was ok and the entertainment system wasnâ€™t working but some passengers did get iPads to use.",Positive,Much better than before !!,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"Best connection to London from Dhaka. Biman just introduced the brand new 787-9 on this route. Excellent business class seats, full bed with good screen size. Individual seating configuration 1-2-1 in business class. It has also 21 premium economy class, quite good given the price. Overall service was excellent. Highly recommend to fly Biman........ ",Positive,New Boeing 787-9,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
Traveled in Biman after long. Experience was better than I expected. Unfortunately I flew in one of the leased air crafts of Biman with little leg space and no in flight entertainment. Food was tasty and crew service was good.,Mixed,Getting better,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"I traveled several times in recent years using Biman and almost each time received good services. Good food, good seating arrangements and comparatively a better ground services. Staffs on board are just OK though. Ground staffs should be more courteous. My last travel ticket price was high though.",Positive,"Good craft, good food",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"Flew on a B787-8. The aircraft was of course super-good, especially on the Business Class, on which me and my wife were travelling. Very comfortable flight with sleeperette seats almost a full 180Â° recline, superb aircontioning, beautiful lighting. The on- board service could be better-- it's not as sophisticated as other airlines. The food is ok with enough choices. The departure & arrival was punctual and the ride smooth and nice, professionally handled by the flight crew. Give them some more time and Biman airlines will be good.",Positive,Tries hard to please.,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"In absence of Jet Airways, I flew to Delhi and then took Biman Bangladesh Airlines. Flight was little old. Staff was very hospitable. No inflight entertainment to pass time. Food was nice.Not a great option to fly but not bad too given the choices.",Mixed,Hospitable staff - no inflight entertainment,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
Terrible. Food was below average on the plane. Donâ€™t ever use this airline. The hotel they booked for our transit in Dhaka was absolutely filthy and had bugs and flies in the bedrooms. Couldnt sleep at all due to how filthy it was.,Negative,AVOID,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

"I fly to Dhaka in a small plane, 3-3 seat.really congested with all men passengers.discomforting as I'm travelling with 2 kids. The crew was also having their hands full. Flying back to kuala Lumpur was a different experience altogether. The flight was big 3-4-3 seats. All passengers are mix with families and women. The crews are professional and warm.it was a nice experience.",Positive,Service depends on flight and crew,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
Very good services. Price is very reasonable. Chair can be totally flat for comfortable. Air stewardess are helpful You could most amenities like from other airlines.,Positive,Pleasant night trip,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"I took biman bangladesh for thailand. Flight was scheduled and departed at right time. In flight food, drinks were awsome. Hot food and tea/ coffee were served. It was a new Boeing dreamliner-787 biman bought. Economy class leg space is good too. Overall a great experience.",Positive,Enjoyable flight,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"They need to improve a lot. Though this is one of the best airlines of Bangladesh, still it must learn some antiques from other international airlines. Flights are quite comfortable and maintaining the local hospitality.",Mixed,One good service,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"I was flying on 20th October, left on time, old plane but clean.Very helpful staff, courteous and careful about the comfort of the passengers.",Positive,Very caring,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"Despite leaving home 6 hours before check in closed, my 2 hour journey took 4 hours due to sudden and severe snowfall. Got to check in with 30 minutes to spare, but wasnt allowed to join the queue as the number of people waiting already meant they would breach check in closure times (apparently), even though the flight was delayed by 3 hours BECAUSE of the weather!!!!Was advised that if the Biman office called and cleared me to board, they'd let me check in. My agent got Biman office to call and the person who received the call then checked my ticket and boarding pass, but did nothing else. Before I knew it, they'd cleared out the check in area and I was left with no choice but to book a hotel and pay for new tickets for the next day.Typical of a backwards country airline, they conveniently have no desk at LHR for people to make enquiries or complaints. When I eventually travelled out the next day, the flight was delayed by about 3 hours due to bad weather. Again, no Biman staff at LHR to provide food or drink vouchers like other reputable airlines do. I therefore booked into a lounge as the airport was packed out, but they never refunded me for that expense when the provision of food and drinks for a 3+ hour delay is technically their responsibility.The flight itself was relatively calm. In flight movies were old and headphone ports didn't work. Food definitely needs to improve. Staff on the plane were very nice though and their attention to customer needs was pretty good too. That's the ONLY positive part of this whole ordeal.Came back to UK at the end of Jan and despite several emails to Biman with details of what happened, their poor service at the airport etc and it resulting in me being forced to buy a new ticket, they've NEVER responded. I even sent letters to their head office in Bangladesh, but still nothing. After 6 months of chasing them for a response, I finally gave up and will NEVER fly with them again.",Negative,Worst airline ever,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"Dhaka to Jessore flight was on time and and was good. However on our way back the flight was delayed two times for total of 2.5hrs. They provide light snacks at the plane ( water, dry cake and chicken pastry) which is a plus point given the duration of the flight is only 20mins.",Positive,Overall good experince,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
Biman airlines is the worst it was so bad the food took forever and when it came the food wasn't even cooked so i didn't eat it,Negative,never take Biman airlines,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
It was a Boeing 737-800 narrow body jet. Flight was just on time. take off was perfect and the cabin crews were very cordial. the flight catering was perfect for me and I guess travelers from all over the world would like it. very much professional attitude. last but not the least the landing of Biman Pilots just simply amazing!!! they r the best in landing .,Positive,home in the sky,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"I have flown with Biman for Nepal after 25 years. I was really scared by reviews but the experience was unexpectedly great! I am a nervous flyer so I tend to notice every single little thing. It was on time, no delay. The flight was very smooth, no rough take off or landing whatsoever. The pilot was really skilled. Food was not upto the mark but oh well...it was a very short flight so I can forgive that. The crews were polite. The interior was really nice (everything was jamdani printed which definitely shows our heritage). Overall, very satisfied <3 ",Positive,Unexpectedly great,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

"Worst airline food I have ever eaten, Biman Airways should consider just serving some sandwiches on this sector, cause the food is inedible, tasteless, oily with no flavour what so every, most passengers left all or most of thier food untouched, surely someone is checking this rubbish they serve?

I have been flying biman since itâ€™s started direct flight to sylhet I must say the service have been poor but this year I have traveled 5 times only last few times I have noticed an improvement so congratulations My flight Saturday 19th October 2019 the entertainment screen in the entire plane wasnâ€™t working at all But the captain have been very apologetic which is surprising so keep it up,Positive,No entertainment,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
First of all perfect timing which is now reflect a better condition and professionalism.Flight environment was improved,Positive,Quality Improved,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"It is easy to find a lot of less than complimentary reviews of Biman Bangladesh in the internet so on this, my first experience with them, I would be lying if I said I had no concerns. However, the flight to Chittagong was a fairly new 737 with a Business Class section and on the way back a fairly new Bombardier turboprop. Both very clean on the inside and no dramas at all on either flight. Granted, in flight service was basic but it is less than 1 hour flight so no issue there. I would be fine flying again with Biman and keep in mind that they are safety approved for flights in and out of EU airspace.",Positive,Much better than expected,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"First time took Biman to London on a 777-300ER. Just great connection to London. Its almost 11hrs flight, flight departs around 10.15am BST and arrives in London by 3.45pm GMT. Business class seats are comfortable and food is good. Service level has improved and crew are very well trained. Flight entertainment is not the best but it is OK. Cost is very reasonable compared to other airlines. Emirates, Kuwait, Gulf Air, Qatar and Turkish airlines fly via their hub to London from Dhaka and it takes much longer due to transit plus the fare is higher by 30% to 50% than Biman. So value for money and fastest connection, I would highly recommend Biman. Ground handling needs more improvement. Other than that, super service and Biman should increase its frequency to 7 days, I think there is enough demand. ",Positive,Fastest connection to UK,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"After confirming with the airline that they operate the new Dreamliner on the route, we booked DAC-DXB in business class. This route has a 1hr technical stop in Chittagong before proceeding to Dubai. If your destination is Dubai, then you cannot get off the plane in Chittagong. I was only willing to fly this route with Biman on their new Dreamliner. Their other planes are ancient. The aircraft was indeed the 787 Dreamliner. Business class seat was full lay flat. Comfortable seats, although not comparable to business class on flagship carriers. Unfortunately 3 business class seats were occupied by snotty, screaming kids with a mother unwilling to control them and flight attendants unwilling to care. Flight attendants did even attempt to calm the kids or assist the mother.Food is barely edible. Very greasy, spongy, and chewy. Some items unidentifiable. We left most of it uneaten. Here's the real problem: Biman simply cannot keep a time schedule. We've flown them a number of times and they are ALWAYS late. Today, we departed Dhaka only 10 minutes late, which was remarkable. But then we landed in Chittagong 20 minutes late. By the time we left Chittagong we were 2 hours late. By the time we landed in Dubai we were 2.5 hrs late. We had a connecting flight on another airline, which we missed, and forced to pay rebooking fee for that airline. We had to wait for the next flight so we lost a night's sleep which defeated the purpose of buying the Biman business class seat in the first place. Biman customer service is terrible. As we got further and further behind schedule, there were no apologies, no explanation. There is no alcohol on Biman, even in international business class.The price was right for this business class product, but the persistent tardiness of Biman is a huge deterrent. In the end we lost time, lost sleep, lost money, and arrived frustrated. I don't recommend Biman.",Negative,We tried Dhaka-Dubai business class in the new Dreamliner. It was a mistake.,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

"They canceled my flight a week before flying. I had a domestic Biman flight in Bangladesh which I couldn't take as a consequence. Despite the Kathmandu Biman guy saying switching flights would be OK, and despite my emailing them asking for my Domestic flight to be switched to the changed day, in Bangladesh they said it was my fault I had missed the flight. They didn't care that Biman had canceled the international flight. As far as they were concerned they are two separate organisations.",Negative,Customer service is lacking,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"Overall had a very good experience with biman on both legs. I will go point wise and will be easier to comprehend. 1. We were lucky to get the brand new dreamliner. The business class configuration was 2-2-2 so everyone had aisle access.2. Check in was fast and quick. We were given the fast track card to use at lhr. We used EBL lounge at Dhk airport but wife tried Bimans Muslin lounge. Food was good and mainly local. 3. Boarding was done on time and we took our seats. Was super comfortable and fully flat bed with plenty of leg space, big screen tv with ok entertainment channels. 4. Onboard service was just above average. The cabin crew needs to smile more and at least dhow they are willing to go the extra mile for business class passengers. We are paying a premium and hence expect premium service. 5. Biman doesn't serve alcohol but enroute from LHR-DAC you can huy the mini bottles mainly whiskey, gin, vodka. 6. Food was good but their second mesl was below par. Why serve fried items when it just gets all soggy? See pic pls. Their local meals were very good. 7. Their cheeseboard platter was average. Should have a variety and with premium crackers.8. Toilet was a bit too small for business class cabin.9. LHR to DAC was comfortable and we had a good sleep. I was really hungry and literally requested a second meal and was given.10. Reached London on time- however the taxing is a really far away corner and we walked 20 min to go to immigration.Overall had a good experience with Biman.

"For the first time, I used this airline and not satisfied at all. The flight delayed and they consistently provided wrong information about the flight. Though it was said to go to the counter 30 minutes prior to departure, but they closed their counter 40 minutes earlier. However, the take-off was fine or smooth but the landing was horrible.

"Review of Biman Business Class DAC-KUL. I've flown and reviewed Biman a number of times over the last 3 years. It has not improved... in fact, I think it has gotten worse. If Business is this bad, imagine Economy. Here's my notes from the flight:â€¢ The bus took us out to the plane, but the the plane wasn't ready, so they dumped all passengers on the curb at the foot of the stairs to the plane, and we all stood there for a good 20 minutes outside with absolutely no information from any staff. Unsafe, unprofessional, disrespectful. (see pic)â€¢ Departed 1 hr late.â€¢ Food in lounge inedible, greasy, disgustingâ€¢ Strange box in my seat area on the flood upon boarding, no attempt by crew to move it. I had to kick it out of my seating area. Just strange, very disrespectful. (see pic).â€¢ No alcohol, even in business class.â€¢ Seat broken switch. â€¢ They use the overhead bins over business class row 3 to store a ton of stuff that you'd think belong in the galley. So, not even enough room for a backpack above my business class seat.â€¢ So she spent a commutative hour of the flight rummaging in the bin over my head. Distracting, annoying, and disrespectful to the customer.â€¢ Flight attendant had to use a butter knife to release the remote from the arm rest.â€¢ When we ordered dinner, flight attendant seemed extremely perplexed by our decisions. Like it was also the first time she had ever seen the menu. â€¢ Flight attendant used her gloved hand to wipe her runny nose immediately before serving dinner. â€¢ Threw the napkins at us. â€¢ Took a full 1.5 hrs after take off before dinner served in business class. I continue to fly Biman because they offer day-time flights and a cheaper ticket, especially in Business Class. But seriously this has got to be one of the worse airlines in the entire world.",Negative,Another trip on Biman... another pretty lackluster experience. Very disrespectful to paying customers.,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"We had a terrible flight experience with them. At the airport, the officials were confused about the charge for extra weight. They made us wait almost an hour to clear the check-in.

Flew business class from Bkk to Dac and was absolutely worth it given the price. Check in was fast with 45kgs allowed for the 2 hour flight. Fast track enabled quick security check and immigration. I was given access to the miracle lounge near the gate which was decent and comfortable. Biman uses the old 737 800 which has the old type business class seats. No tv though but really didn't matter for the 2 hour flight. Only thing missing was the foot rest which would have made it perfect. Seats were spacious and comfortable with sufficient recline. Onboard service was warm and friendly and courteous. Food was good and filling and menu had good options. On arrival seperate cars were available for business class passengers which enabled us to reach immigration faster. Would definitely recommend biman's business class more so due to the convenient timing b/c a quick nap between 4pm to 6 pm is perfect for this type of cabin. Thank you.,Positive,Very comfortable and convenient!,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"Being a frequent traveller I mostly fly Emirates, Saudia, Qatar, gulf air. Had a really bad experience with Biman a while ago so decided to fly with Biman business class this time. Booked online and no problem at all. Check in superb the airport lounge was nice and clean. Lovely London Sylhet flight with superb service. Return flight was not brilliant as I had to come to Sylhet airport at 3 am for the 10 am flight from Dhaka. The Maslin lounge wasnâ€™t brilliant in my view, the food wasnâ€™t fresh.

"I have used Biman before but not long haul. I chose this flight over other carriers because itâ€™s the only non-stop flight, itâ€™s baggage allowance was better and it was cheaper. I think the problem is that because of this, they can fill a huge plane every time so they donâ€™t have to try too hard on customer service. I was suspicious when our departure time changed to an hour earlier but arrival time didnâ€™t. When we arrived nice and early to check in, there was a queue but no staff and after 30 mins of waiting the departure time changed back 45mins later. Eventually we got checked in but had basically arrived an hour too early and had to hang around. When we went to the gate it was very full so we stood expecting that boarding would soon start. After an hour I went back out to the desk to see what the delay was and was told that the captain had not arrived!When the captain finally showed up and boarding began, a single door was opened and everyone barged through with no staff in sight. So we were told to come an hour early and ended up flying an hour and a half late. There was no apology or evening mention of delay and at no time was there any communication from airline or airport staff. It is an 11 hour flight and there are 2 very basic meals. By midday I had been up 7 hours with nothing but an airport coffee in my stomach and I was given a cup of tepid water. At sometime between the 2 meals I was staring at my broken screen and I was in need of a snack. No staff were in the aisles so I went to the galley. There were self service soft drinks so I got the tepid water and asked if there were snacks. I was given some very dry cake which I was told was â€˜absolutely freeâ€™. No, they havenâ€™t quite got the international carrier concept but then they donâ€™t care. ",Negative,Customer care is ZERO,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

"My third flying experience with Biman. Do they really care what we write? Traveling with this airline has always been strange, funny, weird and full of unpleasant surprises. So after my recent travel with Biman, this is what we experienced.I was flying to Bangkok. So first of all upon check in your staffs were surprising a bit friendly. That was the first though. You all usually are not that friendly, smiling and helpful. So I hope you all keep that up. Secondly your food service seems to be different from DEPARTURE to ARRIVAL. On the way to Bangkok the plane was very well clean, all seats had TV monitor and your meals were well portioned and with tea and coffee. But on the way back it was a whole new dimension. The food was limited without salad and no tea or coffee? And no TV? No blankets? Whats up with that? Thats not really fair. We paid in full for the service for TO and FROM and we should expect it exactly right. This is just with you Biman. No other airlines does this. So the flight on the way back from BKK, I was so looking forward to have my coffee with the cake that came with the meal. I mean you cancelled Tea and Coffee totally? Is it that bad that you cant provide a bit of tea which is an essential thing among Bangladeshi nationals? You also charge for wheel chair? What other airlines does that? On the way to Bangkok I was watching a movie and I was enjoying it but towards the end you have to put that LONG Biman ADVERT and I felt like thats it, its over. I put away my headphone and all got ready for landing. But then again you put the movie back on right after the ADVERT. Didnt felt like watching it because it was so annoying with your disturbances. You could have had that ADVERT put just as we have LANDED. Thats all other airlines do. You all lack CONSISTENCY in every aspect. In the beginning you all are like SUPER FANTASTIC and after few WEEKS you all become zero and you all stay at zero. Staying CONSISTENT in this business of SERVICE SECTOR is the key. No matter what, how little or much you provide, you have to set and keep a proper ground on it. The meal you provide is just good enough. I like your meal. But you are not being consistent wit it. Like I said earlier one day this but the next day its something else for the same price. Why is it everywhere in every aspect the organization lack decency, lack respect and lack morale? Can this organization do something right? I mean the Airport is a mess....starting with the parking lot. Have any one of you (officials) been there? Especially that part where the arrival passengers come with their luggage with trolley and wait for their cars. Its nasty looking and so dirty. Is this how a INTERNATIONAL airport suppose to look like? I can go on and on. But I feel thats enough for now. Lets see how you all respond to this. Its no rocket science people. TAKING CARE OF SOMETHING or SOMEONE comes from HOME and its all COMMON SENSE.",Negative,Its much of the same,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

Now with Jet stopped and no direct flights between Delhi and Dhaka, we had no option but to take Biman, I was surprised by the timely performance, in-flight service and the meal quality and quantity. It was a Ramadhan day and the airline served a fast-breaking meal (iftaar) to all the passengers, followed by a sumptuous dinner.

"I booked tickets for me and my wife from Kolkata to Yangon via Dhaka. It was one way flight at higher price to utilize some spare time at Yangon. 3-4 days before the journey Biman Kolkata Office informed me that either I have to cancel the tickets as only one hour lay over time is not allowed for international connecting flights, or I may travel a day before to Dhaka, stay there overnight and catch the Yangon flight following morning. Upon enquiry they agreed to arrange for hotel if we paid the transit visa charges. I enquired to their officer at the Kolkata airport again regarding our stay and she told that everything has been taken care of. Upon our arrival at Dhaka, Biman transit desk told us that they didn't receive any email from Kolkata office and as per their regulation they couldn't provide us a hotel. They tried to contact Kolkata office on our request but failed to do so. We're kept waiting there for four hours and then decided to pay for the hotel from my pocket. Once in the van provided by them they rang up the driver, bought us again on the airport driveway, got into the van and told that they were now able to contact the Kolkata office and would pay for the hotel stay themselves. The hotel we're taken into was a horrible one with high handed staff behaviour and food quality matching equally. Only good thing was the driver taking us in time to the airport back early in the morning. Quite a horrible experience at this age indeed!",Negative,Terrible service,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

"There's nothing worse than travelling on an unsafe airline, sitting next to someone who's just witnessed a crash by the same airline and can't stop talking about it, with air stewards not even doing proper safety checks.After much reluctance I decided to purchase a ticket on Biman, which doesn't have a great safety record, from Dhaka to Kathmandu.I thought ""Surely safety comes first"". Then this woman sitting next to me who had just transferred from Yangon explains she witnessed a Biman plane nosedive and crash the day before. She was due to board that very aircraft back to Dhaka. Google it, it happened.Meanwhile on our Kathmandu bound flight, at no point did the cabin crew (at least visibly) make that extra safety check, let alone check that everyone's seat belts were securely fastened or that the cabin was free from potential obstructions in case of an evacuation. The staff were extremely arrogant throughout.And while service shouldn't (isn't?) related to safety, there was none of it. Seated in the first row after business, no sooner had we bitten into our sandwiches did the stewardess walk out and say ""You done yet?"" rolling her eyes when we said we'd just started. I couldn't stop thinking of the airline's crash the day before: in such situations one can't help but think they won't give a damn.And me being picky, I noticed the cabin was filthy inside. Again, I hope that dirt does not equate to lower safety, but poor maintenance does nothing to reassure passengers on an airline with an already poor reputation. The airline knows its image is not squeaky clean, yet does little to make passengers feel at ease.",Negative,"Appalling service despite great views of Everest, felt unsafe",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

"I have traveled so many times with this airline, both economy and business class. There is nothing good I can say about this airline except for 40kg limit and goes direct to Sylhet. It is the worse plane and airline service I have ever traveled in and ever will. Even when I went Business class the service was poor. The entertainment system did not work at all both way, luckily I was able to recline my seat and sleep. Food was ok, they give you a lot, specially in Business class. What I didn't like is it was very oily. Price for economy is also expensive as it will be cheaper to travel by other airline (back in the days British Airways used to go there but the government doesn't like competition). The service is poor, that staff lack any manner as they don't care. Flights are always delayed and never on time (not sure why they can't correct this even from Bangladesh as they are like the only operator in the airport in Bangladesh, so no logical reason for delay. Not sure why don't have direct flights from Sylhet to London, instead they do transit via Dhaka, where the staff hassle you a lot saying unless you pay them, your luggage will not make it to its destination. Also they make you stay over night in Dhaka even thou your travelling from Sylhet (I suppose its the doggy politician want to make some money for them self by making passengers stay in their hotel)Last time I went with my father and traveled in Business class as he needs wheel chair. Before I come back I went to confirm my ticket in Sylhet office and also to confirm that my father will get a wheel chair. To get a confirmation that there will be wheel chair I had to pay them? really. When the plane stopped in Dhaka for transit we were taken to business class lough which was very good (even if I travel economy I will pay extra to stay go to business class lough nest time as seating is better and there is hot food and drink. However there was a worker pushing my dad wheel chair, they will not push him unless I pay them. I gave them Â£5, but that was not enough they wanted more. Only when i gave them Â£10 GBP, they start to push him to the plane. I have complained since I came back to UK but no response.Personally I would never travel with such airline but because of my parent I may use it one more.

"We have travelled as a family from London to Dhaka first time in our life with Biman and this would be our last trip. We have travelled 42 countries some of them several times around the world in five continents so used over 200s flights. 1. Toilet tissue paper ran out despite request to the crews no action taken 2. Cabin crews need further training3. Our family members were split with two teenage children and sat differently. 4. In twelve hours flight one main meal and one snack which are inadequate. It should be two snacks at least 5. Flights were delayed for nearly three hours6. Met a newly wed couple from London who missed the flight from Dhaka because the flight was overbooked 7. If you are not bothered about delay, missing the flight for overbooking, customer services, and splitting up the family seating arrangements then feel free to use Biman.

"Was delighted to find a new 787 aircraft on service for our flight that day. Unfortunately when inside, found the seats are much cramped. There were 9 seats in a row, instead of 8 seats normally. Service of cabin crew is also unimpressive. They were just doing their duty, but not in a professional manner. One male steward was collecting the food tray and putting those in the trolly. He pushed so hard that some trays with unfinished mill and garbage etc. just rolled out from another side, making a mess in front of my seat. Though he cleaned it but that wetty messy stained path area was awful. Had to seat beside that messy area for rest of my flight time. That steward took that incident very casually and tried to close the trolly door by kicking. Maybe this way they have broken the locks of food trolly. Other female hostess were elderly and could not walk properly even. Suggestion: 1.

Boarding was similar to other airlines: pretty efficient. The boeing 777-300 appeared to be in serious need of an interior-refurb. Seats were in a dilapidated state. Entertainment-system controls were broken on some seats. So (for example) My wife's screen was stuck on a blank full brightness display for the whole 9 hout flight with no way to change or switch off. Loos were also in serious need of updating. The soap dispenser barely worked. Staff seemed overworked and inattentive but friendly enough when I requested something basic (like a cup of water) when going by the galley. They didn't offer my toddler any friendly encouragement or the usual game to keep him occupied (we were prepared with things for him anyway) neither did I see any other cistern on the flight get any friendly attention from the staff. Meals were decent. Mains spicy and sides etc OK.The only saving grace of this Biman route (and why we decided to use it) is that it was non-stop to Sylhet so we didn't need to deal with all the... &%+!Â£ in Dhaka (which we would have if we'd used any other airline) and travelling between it and Sylhet with our toddler in tow.,Mixed,I guess you can't really expect more?

Overall, Biman need to take care the customer service more.",Negative,A small Dash8 airlines for a international route.,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"Flights were comfortable, staff were friendly, a meal and drinks were part of the service. We arrived at Dhaka, our visas were declined for no given reason and we were told to wait in Bimans transit area. This was freezing cold & mosquito ridden & had to wait all night for a flight out. Our passports were taken from us and we were under police watch. Asked for passports in the early morning and police couldnâ€™t find them and didnâ€™t care. The Biman attendants were very helpful and went searching, found the passports 30 minutes before the flight. They flew us out without charging extra for the flight. We were very impressed and thankful for Biman for getting us out. Had it been up to the Immigration Police we might have been stuck there for days.",Positive,A Huge tick for Biman Bangladesh,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

"We arrived at Bangkok airport 3 hours before our scheduled departure of 4:15pm. The big check-in board already listed our flight, but we were surprised to see it listed as 9:00pm. At the check-in desk they confirmed that the flight was already FIVE HOURS LATE and the aircraft had not yet even left Dhaka. Luckily we were in Business Class and we were allowed to wait in the Miracle Lounge in Bangkok for that whole time. But this is really unacceptable. The food in Business Class was ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING and totally inedible. I mean, they must have scraped this off the street in Dhaka. It was revolting. Good thing we ate in the Miracle Lounge in Bangkok. Furthermore, although last week's flight from DAC-BKK featured the brand new Dreamliner, this return flight from BKK-DAC did not. It was a total piece of junk ancient plane. Business class seats were EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE. Do not book this route thinking you'll get the Dreamliner because they apparently don't use it every day. I've flown Biman many times and it is hit-or-miss.

From Kuala Lumpur to Bangladesh the plane stops at Kolkota (India) for 5 hours, passengers remain on the plane and are not given entertainment access or food for the reasons in Bangladesh is in bad weather. All the passengers were angry and tired. After that i have only have 15 minutes to transit from Bangladesh to Kathmandu. When i arrived in Kathmandu my baggage lost!!!!

"I will never ever take Biman airlines ever again. Transit hotel was infested with cockroaches and rats which were visible - had to change rooms 3 times! The Biman and airport staff in both Sylhet and Dhaka consistently give misinformation to try make money. Biman staff have absolutely zero professionalism and only know how to make a profit out of people's misfortune. I am honestly baffled at how uneducated and unprofessional these people are.Our flight from Sylhet to Dhaka was cancelled and they didn't inform us until we got to the airport. Airport staff were VERY rude, no people skills whatsoever. They weighed our suitcases inaccurately in order to charge us a ridiculous amount (250,000 taka, approx Â£250) for an extra 12kg luggage- the staff member was clearly lying as he changed the figure as soon as a senior member of staff was lurking around behind him. Instead of compensating us for the cancelled flight with no notification, they had the cheek to ask for money for their inaccurate weighing. The tone and manner they spoke in was disgraceful, very threatening and they were actually mocking and laughing at the misery they were putting us through behind the counter. If that wasnt enough, the staff at hand luggage security in Dhaka tried to throw away my facial cleanser (worth Â£55) without my consent! DISGUSTING behaviour by DISGUSTING staff who aren't even worth the title of being a human.May i add, the airport security are very weak- when i was being searched by a female member of staff, she was more interested in watching Youtube on her phone, she literally just touched my arms and told me to go. What sort of security is this? I could be carrying all sorts and they would not have a single clue!I travel to Bangladesh often and love the country but the Biman airline is a DEFINITE NO for us 'foreigners'. Honestly, i feel so proud and happy to be a British Citizen, experiences like these make me not want to visit Bangladesh again. Just a warning to everyone who I always encourage to visit Bangladesh... take an airline such as Emirates or Qatar!

"In mid-Dec 2018 we took off on time DAC-BKK. We flew business class on Biman's new Dreamliner. Service good. Seats comfortable. This brand new aircraft was already dirty and broken. It's astonishing how quickly things degrade here. If you can guarantee the new aircraft and on time departure, then this is a pretty good deal in business class. Unfortunately, Biman is virtually always late, aircraft can't be guaranteed, and already this brand new craft is a mess. Maybe I recommend... 6 out of 10 based on cheap price.

Worst airline to travel with! shame they dont allow other aircrafts to travel to Sylhet. Its time for people traveling with this stupid airline to stop using them and boycott this Biman and demand change as nothing has changed over the years.

It was the first time flying with them. What a waste of my time first flight from Yangon to Dhaka had a delay of 2 hours no information why or excusses. When we arrived we found out that our flight of 45 minutes to Kolkata had a delay of first 3 hours then 4 hours and in the end 5 hours. No information and when I asked to get lounge access to compesate for this delay I have been treated as rubbish by the staff. I am going to tell you do not fly with them they will not inform you and do not make any excus about why they are delayed. The also do not refund or give you anything they do not care.

My brother and I were on our way to Kolkata. No transport was provided despite paying for wheelchair facility. After making a fuss my brother was taken to the aircraft in a transport as he has difficulty walking. On the way back blood soiled wheelchair was provided and after an argument another came which was less soiled. There were five passengers in Business Class. When we arrived in Dhaka two cars and a microbus was by the aircraft. I told the Biman official that my brother had difficulty with his legs and a car would be more suitable but was toldOne car was for the MPThe other was for a VIP and we were not allowed to share any of the cars The microbus was for us So we go to the microbus to find the only other Business Class passenger is inside and in the first row there are two men sitting. It was difficult for my brother to manouvre and get in so I told the driver that these two men were not in Business Class so why are they in this microbus. After an unpleasant exchange the driver then tells me to go in the car. I told him we were not going to do that. We were going in the transport meant for us. The wait continues and each time I told the driver to go he just kept standing until he picked up another man and a group of two women and a young boy. By this time I was extremely agitated and said to the group that you were not in Business Class and why are we waiting for you.

"Biman Bangladesh is a Airline where if you buy early you can get really good rates. Even buying late the rates are significantly lesser than other national airlines of other countries. The weight allowance is crazy 35 of usually for economy & 45 kg for business Have not seen any other airline give that kind of baggage weight allowance.

We were taking a family vacation to see relatives in Sylhet. We were a group of six people. We checked in and boarded without a hitch and were seated towards the rear of the aircraft. Plus points were we sat in a row of six. We took off and I heard a loud noise underneath the aircraft I looked at everyone but no one seemed to be concerned. I thought it was the undercarriage and settled in. The food was served after an hour or so. Food was average for economy so no qualms. I had issues with the tv screens as some of our screens were knackered so had to bite the bullet.As this flight was direct to Sylhet it was a 10 hour flight. Downside the children didnâ€™t get any toys so it was noisy. Anyway as we were over India and about 1 and a half hours to land we had an announcement from the captain. He announced that Heathrow airport had called and told them that they had found tyre debris of our plane on the tarmac. The plane would have to be diverted to Dhaka so that they could fix the issues. Everyone including myself was anxious thinking how are we going to land!We approached the Dhaka airport and the plane began to descend and everyone was praying.

"I don't like giving out 1 star reviews because every experience usually has some sort of redeeming factor to it, however my experience with Bangladesh Biman was so bad I feel like a 1 star rating is too generous.I was travelling with my wife and 2 children to Dhaka from Sylhet airport on a domestic flight in order to catch a flight from Dhaka to Delhi and then from Delhi to Chennai. I booked a domestic flight from Sylhet to Dhaka to leave at 06.30am on 03/08/2018 in order for us to catch a 10:00am flight to Delhi. We arrived at the airport in good time and were checked in without any problems. The boarding pass said that the flight would board at 06:00hrs and the flight would depart at 06:30hrs. At approximately 06:00hrs a sign came up on the departures screening saying the flight was delayed and the estimated time of departure would be 07:20am. At this point it was still possible for us to connect to our onward flight. However, 07.20 came and went and it wasnâ€™t until 07:50 that the plane arrived at the gate. The plane did not begin to board until 08:20 by which time it was looking more than likely we would miss our flights. There were no members of Biman staff available to speak to and no explanation was given for the delay. We arrived in Dhaka at approximately 09:00hrs at which point Biman staff on the tarmac were busy ferrying passengers travelling to London on to one bus whilst putting all other passengers on another bus. We did not arrive at the domestic terminal until 09:15hrs and by the time we had collected our bags and arrived at the international terminal our flight had already boarded.At Shahjalal International, I approached the Bangladesh Biman counter and attempted to speak to your representative. It was the first time in my life that I had met a person with so little compassion or empathy in my life. She did not apologise at any point for the delay, she did not at any point acknowledge the fact that the delay had resulted in us missing our flights nor did she offer any solutions. All she kept repeating was that it was not the fault of Bangladesh Biman that I had booked tickets with their airline and that I should have expected delays. Eventually, after realising that your member of staff, was in no way willing to assist me, I was forced to purchase tickets to fly to Kolkata from Dhaka at an additional expense of BDT 25,330. I was told that the earliest flight was at 19:20hrs and therefore I had to wait in the arrivals area of the terminal with my 2 children for 7 hours before check-in opened. In typical fashion the 19.20pm flight was delayed until 20:00hrs and then of course by the time we boarded it was 20:30hrs. I had to then pay for a hotel overnight in Kolkata as there were no connecting flights to Chennai and then had to purchase fresh tickets to Chennai. The arrogance of the staff member at the Bangladesh Biman desk in Dhaka was astounding, there was no reasoning with her and she was not going to even listen to the points I was making.This was the first (and last time) I flew with Bangladesh Biman and we arrived home 20 hours after the time we should have. I have complained to Bangladesh Biman, but given that they have the monopoly over flights coming in and out of Sylhet, I am sure my words will be dismissed in an equally arrogant manner as to the way I was treated in Dhaka by their representative.",Negative,40 minute flight turns to 40 hours in transit,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"The most common issue with Biman Bangladesh is its timing. Flight arrives late & leaves late also. If you think of taking a connecting flight then be careful.

Because she was not yet 2 at the time of travel she did not have a seat. Economy seats were so cramped up, there was no leg room for me forget my toddler on my lap. However business class seats were amazing, from the seats to the service to the good and overall experience was great. I would highly recommend and will definetely be flying with them again.

So you get 1meal and 1 snack through this 11 hr flight. Theres no inflight entertainment if you are unlucky like me because all their screens dont work. It was the same on my flight back. Flew Biman because they are the only airline with direct flight.Its not like the flight was cheap. I could have flown Turkish for less and Qatar for a couple of thousand takas more, $ 30 more...oh wellThe flight back to Dhaka was another story, its a full flight, as everyone from London is flying back to Sylhet. 9 hrs to sylhet then 1 hr at sylhet while the flight fills up again and then 20 mins to dhaka from sylhet.The worst thing is they have NO USB CHARGER FOR YOU TO CHARGE YOUR PHONE IN ECONOMY!

Reading the reviews i was concerned but i just wanted a direct flight to dhaka without a stop over that doubles the travel time. The reception was excellent and friendly. Business class service was caring and food excellent. Drinks were only juices and soft drinks which would lose some customers. The headphones were great at keeping out noise and IFE was good.The seats were spacious but didnt recline to flat which made sleeping near impossible. Main negative point. Iâ€™d fly them again.,Mixed,Great experience,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"I chose my seats while I bought the ticket from their website but I was issued a different seat during return flight & I wasn't told about this alteration by the check-in counter staff. To make this ever worse; I didnâ€™t realise this till I reached boarding gate.My main luggage was selected for random screening during bag drop (2nd time in a row), it didnâ€™t feel random anymore but more like an arbitrary decision by the same counter staff (maybe because I only had one piece of small main luggage!).I was also told (REFUSED) that I couldnâ€™t use the mileage from my Green membership card to access your lounge even though according to the info on their website I could do so! The staff then suggested that I spoke with their supervisor but without giving further directions and I was left to deal with this by myself.The on-board cleanliness/hygiene & willingness to give a bit of decent service seem to deteriorate by the day.I have been a regular flyer with Biman & advocate to encourage others to fly with Biman however, Iâ€™ll have to think twice before I fly again with them after the recent appalling experience & the ordeal they have put me through; particularly the refusal to access the lounge with the mileage on card.",Negative,Appalling experience,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

The plane was poorly maintained. I had to hold the back of my seat during the whole flight as it was falling down on the passenger at my back. Entertainment system was not working. Food was horrible.

One of the govt service in Bangladesh. They can provide good service but unfortunately they did`t give any perfect service. The Aircraft pilot are very experience .,Mixed,just a govt service,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
Don't know where to start. Let's start with the check in. Check-in: There is no online check in system. As a family (3 year old and a year old) we had pre-booked seats. In heathrow counter when I checked in they put three of us in three different seats and said because of some regulation (Front of aeroplane loaded with cargo) they have to put as many passengers towards the rear end and it's not possible to provide the seats together not even reserved ones. They suggested to talk to crews once the flight reaches the cruising altitude. When spoke to crew they didn't want to listen and understand. Afterwards the captain of the flight had to deal with the issue. Crew members: The crew members were least helpful and don't have any customer service skills. Some old fashioned uniform with a grumpy face. They are walking and eating their food before they serve the passengers.Food: The food quality was poor and fixed menu. They don't have any vegetarian options and difficult to provide any dietary requirements. Seat comfort: The seat comfort is close to nothing. The local buses in UK have comfortable seats compared to the Biman seats. In flight entertainment: 75 % of in flight entertainment was broken. Fortunately i took my kids tablets or else the 11 hour flight would have been nightmare. The screen backside which is really hot is accessible to kids and finger can get through there. The temperature was getting either too cold or too hot within the Biman. They don't switch on the aircon before take off. There are mosquitoes are flying around in flight and biting the kids. They might have came in the flight flew from Bangladesh. I travelled in Biman after 16 years and I am a frequent flyer in different airlines. But this is probably the first and last time I will travel with Biman. The price of the tickets don't reflect the service they provide. They are not particularly any cheaper than other airlines.,Negative,Avoid at any cost,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"Biman is a very basic and simple airline but you get an acceptable level of service as long as you're not expecting too much.Mired with corruption and vested interests, Biman somehow manages to provide a base service that simply exists to get you safely to your destination. We can expect no more. And you should expect no more.Some new Boeing 777 planes make the experience more palatable. Seats are comfy enough for an 9/10/11 hour flight. This also means that Biman planes are better at time-keeping and schedules are much more reliable.Food is not the best in the world of aviation but then you shouldn't expect it to be so for the economy price. Biman flight hosts and hostesses vanish after serving the food and only reappear at the next service time hours later. The flight crew are usually not in a good mood so be careful how you interact with them. In these days of political correctness and hurt feelings any raised voices or harsh words directed at them will result in massive problems for you. Don't raise your voice. Stay calm and endure. Focus on the end result that you want; a safe and hassle-free flight to Sylhet. Remember: THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO FLY DIRECT TO SYLHET FROM THE UK! We have no other choice. Don't let the flight crew's melancholy infect your trip. Leave them to wallow in their private depression. Just say 'thank you' and smile at the appropriate times.I do have some sympathy with the flight crew, however, as Sylheti Bengalis can be some of the most uncouth and uncivilised people you will ever come across. Having said that, you'll also find that Sylhetis are some of the most engaging and fascinating and fun people to spend 9 hours on a plane with. Avoid using the loos if you can. After a couple of hours the loos are unusable. Use the time to watch a movie, get some sleep and save your energy... because your REAL problems will begin as soon as you land in Sylhet! Biman personal in Sylhet and Dhaka airports are crooks in uniforms. In most countries criminals are in jail but it seems in Bangladesh they give them uniforms and salaried positions in the nations airports. Be wary and don't, don't, don't trust any of these bandits. They're not there to help you; only to hinder and obstruct you as much as possible.Once away from the banditry of the airport, you'll discover that Sylhet and Bangladesh are the most beautiful of places you can visit. The colours, the images, the noise, the sounds of the land, the juxtaposition of modernity and innovation with old and classical traditions. The indigenous, local people will welcome you with open arms and offer help and assistance where possible. Help is just a shout and a beckon away.You can be sure that the people in Biman Bangladesh Airlines and the airports DEFINITELY DO NOT represent the best of Bangladesh itself.I would recommend Biman Bangladesh Airlines for the single reason that they operate the ONLY direct flight to Sylhet from the UK. At the time of writing there is no other alternative. You simply get on the plane and 9 hour later you're in Sylhet. For that, I for one, am very grateful.",Mixed,Mediocre But Acceptable,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"Was delayed by TWO HOURS for a THIRTY MINUTE journey. They never give you any updates, information or anything. I donâ€™t think this Airline has ever NOT been delayed even when I flew the next day from Dhaka to London it was delayed again no one gave any information, you are left to your own devices wondering what the hell is going on. I will not be using this Airline ever again unfortunately. My experience has been absolutely awful especially due to the delays on my Sylhet to Dhaka flight. Also when I got off the plane I had to wait a while until the bus came to take us to our terminal (really it should have been there waiting for us) I paid extra to get to my destination quicker than a car but in the end it took me longer from start to finish and I lost a day.

Airline staff asked us to pay for visas which we refused and were ultimately put in the lounge to sit in chairs all night. Biryani was provided as a meal at 1:30 in the morning.

"Avoid Biman Bangladesh Airlines if you have any other choice. Both our flights were delayed - except they weren't, technically, because the airline 'rescheduled' them without giving any notice. This exonerates them of any obligation to passengers and unfortunately may mean you are unable to make a claim on your travel insurance for expenses incurred by the delay. Ground staff were completely unhelpful and repeatedly lied to my face about the reason for delay and the length of delay. They said we had not been contacted in advance because we do not have a Bangladeshi phone number - however, booking had been made online, and an email was sent to us the day before departure inviting us to upgrade - so why not inform us via email, or through our foreign simcards, which we had entered in contact information, including the country code? We ended up having to spend 10 hours in Dhaka airport as a result and I was genuinely worried we wouldn't fly that day. I checked the small print of the T&C and Biman basically say they have no responsibility to the passengers of any kind - they can reschedule and cancel flights with no notice and no obligation to passengers.

"Donâ€™t get me wrong, it is business class but not as you know it! (if you are used to other major carriers that is). Itâ€™s the only direct, albeit with a 1hr stop in Sylet (you donâ€™t get off) flight from LHR to DAC, and for Â£1K and change, itâ€™s hard to complain. The aircraft is a 777-ER I believe, seats are ample with â€˜almostâ€™ fully flat for sleeping. The food is not bad, itâ€™s not what you would normally expect on business class, but again, itâ€™s cheap in comparison. Media is provided in the usual 10inch or so screen in the seat in front, some modern western films but I would recommend the Bollywood ones, much more modern and better quality. Headphones are hilarious giant ear muffs that crackle lots, if you have a headphone adaptor use it with your own set, standard two pin airline affair. USB in seat for charging along but rarely works. Only complaint I have, and itâ€™s a minor one, is that the staff do seem to give off the impression that they are doing you a favour by allowing you onto their plane! If you are a frequent visitor of Bangladesh then you get used to it and so I pay no attention, however if this is your first trip with Biman, bear with it, they are very friendly and helpful, just try to look past the time it takes for them to do anything, it does eventually get done I promise! I travel Biman on average three times a year, and I would always recommend the national carrier of Bangladesh for both work and tourist visits. Note: expect the flight to be delayed by around 2hours leaving Heathrow and also returning from Dhaka. No idea why, itâ€™s never on time! You can get Visa on arrival quite easily now and security at Dhaka is very intensive when leaving for the UK, so prepare for a very long Security queue on the way back.

"1.The Flight BG84(DAC-SIN) departed Dhaka just on time(8:35 AM) and arrived at Singapore one time( 14:35 hrs). Similarly the return flight BG85 departed Singapore on time(15:50 hrs) and and arrived Dhaka on time(18:00 hrs). 2. The aircraft Boeing 737-800 NG is super. The flight was noiseless and very comfortable.3. This is a full service airline and served good hot meal. The ticket price is only USD 300, cheaper than Budget Airlines like Air Asia or Scoot.4. The services of the flight crews was good and they were helpful5. The negative point- the toilets during return flight (SIN-DAC) was dirty, no water and flush did not work!Overall the flight was good (except the point at 5 above).

"If you are planning to take a flight through Biman Bangladesh, please don't !! I reached Dhaka from Delhi at 3 pm and my flight to Chittagong was at 7 pm. I went at 5pm to the counter to check in. The customer services people told me very curtly to come back at 6pm. When i went at 6pm, they said the flight is delayed by one hour. The personnel were busy lazing around and eating something and no uniform. Later when I went back to the counter they said there is a further delay. There were NO announcements. This went on and on and finally the flight left at 10pm. I later came to know from others that this a regular situation with Biman Bangladesh airlines. For my return, I promptly cancelled my Biman flight and took a local one. The other private airlines are not listed on the web when we make the booking. So if you are planning to travel, then search for Novoair, US Bangla or Regent airways. Apparently, these are much better. I returned by US Bangla which was quite good.",Negative,Never travel by Biman Bangladesh,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
As this is National Carrier of Bangladesh they should provide good service. Basically their cabin Crew (Air hostess) seems too illiterate and are too direct to the passengers.

On 19 August 2017 my flight departure was at 09:55 in which myself and family (wife & 3 children) left premise at 05:00 in the morning so we can arrive at dhaka airport on time for checkin which is 3 hours before departure. Upon arriving at dhaka airport we found our flight was 3 hours delayed which I was extremely angry as I has bear the waiting with 2 children and a toddler. And we could not check-in until 10:00. After check-in we got our boarding passes and then we made toward the boarding gate. While waiting at the boarding gate we was hoping to leave at 13:00 (3 hours delayed) but unfortunately it did not happen. We was there until 15:00 (5 hours delayed) in which I was extremely angry. The airline was 5 hours delayed and did not provide any refreshments. After boarding on the plane myself and other passengers was complaining to cabin crew to serve lunches immediately as we have not eaten anything since early morning. On return to london I tried to make a claim for compensation on 5 hours delayed but the terms and condition for flight der claim is that you either have to be travelling from EU country or the airline must be a EU airline. I and my family have suffered heavily on this airline. I can't believe I paid Â£3500 for 3 adult, 1 child and a toddler.

"I was due to fly back to Heathrow from Sylhet via Dhaka. My domestic flight (operated by Biman) got cancelled so they asked us to take the flight the day before from Sylhet to Dhaka. They advised that they would put us up in a hotel for the night before our international flight the day after. I was travelling with my Elderly mother and wife, my mother needs a wheelchair as she had multiple operations on her knee so she is unable to walk long distances. We got to Dhaka Airport, there was no wheelchair available for my mum when we got there so I had to find someone myself to assist us and being Bangladesh everything comes at a price so I had to pay. Eventually we found out that we had to take multiple minivans along with other passengers to the hotel. The wheelchair advisor just left us outside the airport, there was no guidance from the Biman representative. I struggled to get my mother on to the vehicle as it was crammed with people, it was like being in a tin of sardines. The next day it was the same coming back to Dhaka Airport. We also got stopped by the police as our minivan driver did not have the proper paper work to drive (police man were paid off by the driver so he let us continue). When we got to the airport we were dumped outside again without any guidance. We managed to find the Biman transfers desk and I also managed to find a decent wheelchair assistant to help my mother. The flight was then delayed by 5 hours, there was no apology from Biman, there was no refreshment vouchers for the inconvenience.  Most of the passengers behave like animals on the flight, they have no common courtesy for fellow human beings. No respect for the flight attendants and absolutely no manners.The only thing good about the flight was there was no turbulence.The only reason people take Biman is due to the fact that it goes direct to Sylhet.

"Although Biman has many criticisms about the service, mainly for lack of on time departures, the flight I took to KL from Dhaka was fine. The plane was new and clean. Service was ok, food was tasty, although portion was less. The reason the flights are sometime delayed is due to the lack of planes in the fleet.

Hence maybe why the staff were maybe more chilled out.However improvements are required on service, food, hospitality, hygiene levels on the plane and staff few training issues dealing with passengers.Also to back the staff, a long hard training is required to educate and change customer behaviour for atleast 70% of the Biman passengers.Keep up the good work.",Positive,Better journey with improved service,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

My flight out from LHR left 30 mins late although did arrive on time in Dhaka, via Sylhet, and overall the attitude and performance of the cabin crew were good. The return journey was quite the opposite, with delayed flight and no apology or clear announcements - disinterested cabin staff and unattractive menu. Disappointing that they cannot organise priority boarding for business class passengers. Key problem for Biman is they they simply cannot provide consistency or continuity in standards and your never entirely sure or confident about what quality and standard of journey it will prove to be. They really must have a more corporate strategy if they are ever to deliver a comparable brand and service to most other flying in/out of Dhaka. One of its strong points are the direct flight to/from LHR and good value for money on a business/executive class ticket.",Mixed,Gradual Improvements - but must do better if they really aree to be taken seriously as a global airline.,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

Although a 5 hour flight is certainly not a long one but is enough to tire one out after a hectic couple of days at Singapore. Its like your job is over you are on lower stress zone and want to get a relaxed few hours as you fly back home. Biman is in a way home in the air for Bangladeshis. The flight attendants did their best to give a good service. There was a sincere effort and I for one appreciated that. The food was regional with a choices. I am not sure which particular aircraft model we flew but the seats didnt recline as much as I would have wanted it to. For the difference in fare from Economy the quality of seats did nnot justify the fare. I would have been happier if the fare was 15% less closer to what the private sector Bangladeshi carriers charge.I would have rated 'very good' but the fare pricing reduces them to a lower value for many and therefore Average - 3 star.,Negative,"The airline attendants rated a four, but overall average value for money",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

Milage expires without any advance warning and the policy of earning Milage is one of the hardest. There are a lot to improve and learn from other carriers and must improve customer service.

Biman has improved over the years. However there is still a long way to go. The flight from London to Sylhet was delayed. They couldn't find an aircraft. Biman had to borrow an Italian carrier with Italian staff. Some of the Bengali men were sexually harassing female flight crew. Awful. Then a mid air fight broke out between passengers. Disgraceful. We the Bangladeshi people are our own worse enemy. Flight from Bangladesh to London wasn't much better. 1st the woman on x-ray machine wanted a bribe to let our luggage through. Said she wanted money for breakfast. Then the bloke operating the metal detector in Dhaka wanted to confiscate our money as he didn't think we would be having any use of Bangladesh currency in London. Appalling behaviour for a man in uniform. Flight on the way back was good. Lots of empty spaces to stretch out. Nice modern plane with good food. Cabin crew were quite stuck up though and treated the passengers with contempt.

"Biman is the only flight that runs direct flight from London to Bangladesh. It takes only 10 - 12 hours to reach Dhaka. I have used Bimanâ€™s International flights many times.First of all I love the take-off and landing of Biman, it is so smooth. All the Boeings are great but once due to some issues they have rented Turkish airlines and I think the size was a bit smaller than our Boeings, where at the end hours I had breathing issues. I have never called the flight attendants for any issues but all of them were fine with their regular duties.Now the bad sides - as a flight I could not find any issues but the main problems are with ourselves. We the Bangladeshi people are so manner less and stupid.People are smoking in the toilets and risking our lives, attendants are running after them. Passengers are ready with their luggages during the time of landing, they are not listening and not seating and taking out their cabin luggages what can cause serious accidents. Even after landing they start fighting that who can get off first...is it a local bus or what? That is why I always keep seated and get off when all these passengers in a hurry get off first. Our respected passengers shout for food, ask for medicines, block the alleys, and make the toilets dirty like hell. There is a big problem with the people who work for Biman. I was in Bangladesh and needed to change the date of my return flight with the mentioned fine but the officers said there is nothing left. After some requests they asked bribe and offer seats. I have to bribe them because I have to go back to London. But the funny thing is the flight was not full at all and they lied about the seats.Lastly, comfort at some points depend on you. I like to book 3 seats in a row (they have offers) though we are two. Most of the times the back seat TV does not work and you can keep some movies in your gadgets.

"Biman Bangladesh Airlines is rapidly improving its punctuality and the air tickets are very competitively priced. Onboard most international and long-haul flights, all ticket classes are served delectable traditional Bangladeshi cuisine that is exceptional in every way. There is an onboard menu for Business class travelers. The professional cockpit crew and friendly cabin crew are extremely courteous, helpful and hospitable. The spacious seats are very comfortable, especially in the newest planes. Passenger seats and toilets are spotlessly clean. The in-flight entertainment is on par with the best airlines in the world with plentiful touch screens everywhere â€“ side of the seat, front of the seat and giant screens in the front aisle, which allow you to track the progress of the flight very precisely and in great detail. Biman has a good collection of Bengali films and foreign movies in its catalog. It is an excellent airline that is budget friendly and comfortable.I flew Dhaka to Dubai and it was a surprisingly good experience overall. As with all airlines from South Asia, the only problem was the large numbers of mostly uneducated menial workers (self-loading freight) that usually fill the lowest Economy seats and fly regularly to the Middle East and elsewhere. Usually they are brash and donâ€™t miss an opportunity to be noisy, rude and loud.

"My review is just about the CCU-RGN route with a plane change at Dhaka. By far, this is the most economical and efficient service/route through which you can reach Myanmar from India. Hence, I think that the route has potential since Myanmar should get a lot of Indian tourists after it has opened up.There were delays in the Kolkata-Dhaka and the Yangon-Dhaka segments. But they did deliberately delay the connecting flights at Dhaka such that passengers do not get stranded. This deliberate delay suited us more than fine. We paid about 14500 INR for each round ticket between Kolkata and Yangon. Not cheap (compared to European no frills airlines for the distance), but considerably cheaper than competition like Air India.Food was okay - I no longer look at quantity/quality parameters for food in economy flights on most airlines in the world. Who provides great food in such flights.",Mixed,This route has potential: Kolkata-Yangon,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"This was a short flight (2 hours) and a small plane (propeller) so there was no entertainment. Bring your own if you need it. Check-in and boarding were no problem. It actually went quite fast I thought. The box lunch was OK - appetizer (samosa type thing), cheese or chicken sandwich, cake, apple, water. My window was particularly dirty as my camera could only focus on the dirt and not the landscape outside. There was an incident concerning a 'dignitary' who was about to board and wanted the first row instead of his assigned seat in row two. However, someone was already in row one and refused to move. The flight attendant even said the passenger was in the wrong seat when clearly (I saw it) he had the boarding pass for the seat he was in. The dignitary had to sit in row two. This was poorly handled by Biman Airlines although I'm sure they were under pressure from the dignitary. Special treatment for all or for none! Other than that, Biman is a decent budget airline in my opinion.",Negative,Biman - decent budget airline for a short trip,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
I flew with Biman after 22 years and was a little apprehensive. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of service and the smoothness of the flight. The pilots in both legs of the journey were technically sound and flew us to our destination smoothly.,Positive,"Excellent flight quality, friendly staff",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"Due to a recent family emergency I had to cut short a family trip. As I had not booked a return to london with any airline I thought i would give Biman a try as i last used them about 8 years ago.Lets start with groundstaff. Anyone with a biman logo on their top is useless. Any questions asked i was normally passed onto someone else equally clueless.Plane take off was delayed. No reason given, staff just blanking passengers questions. When we did eventually manage to get the plane off the ground we was given lunch consisting of bland chicken, rice and a little salad bowl. The flight was for 10 hours. Passengers given lunch and nothing else until 2 hours before landing. Tge snack in question contains a meat pate soaked in oil and a coupleof pakoras.Really not worththe effort.Air stewardesses have this air of arrogance about them. I was scared to ask for simple things like a cup of water as i was not sure what kind of response i would get.All in all I dont blame bangladesh biman. I blame myself for not choosing emirates as i normally do.If your thinking of flying biman DONT, JUST DONT!!!!",Negative,I blame myself!!!!,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"Well, I heard this airbus was bigger one but unfortunately I didn't get that airbus as that was used for Hajj flight.

"Biman had some terrible record for departing on time, but I must say they have improved a lot in the recent past.

"My Experience with Biman Bangladesh Airlines was HORRENDOUS. You would think their on-line reservation system would be correct....guess again. Someone confused AM with PM. I sent the airline several messages and was told i was wrong. I even sent them my confirmation, and they still insisted I was wrong until I took a screen shot of the airports information as to when the flight was to leave. Then they listened to me. It is a huge difference by 12 hours!When I arrived to Dhaka via Kuala Lumpur (KL) the flight had been rescheduled TWICE--read that as two days difference. I thought the flight was never going to leave which cost me additional hotel stays in KL.Once we arrived to Dhaka, no one was there to open the jetbridge. We stayed on the ramp w/o access to the main hall for 20 minutes. The guards could not find the key to open the lock. Add insult to injury, once we got through customs and to baggage, we waited for 2 HOURS. There was no one to unload the baggage onto the conveyor belt. RIDICULOUS!",Negative,"Incorrect Time Schedule, Horrendous Landing, Jetbridge not opened",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
Very old aircraft. Shabby interior. As the distance Was very short so a less expensive carrier will allow you to forget other short comings.,Mixed,Ok,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
Took a short flight with Biman after a long while. It was newly acquired B737 by Biman and everything was nice and shiny. What really amazed me was that the flight was on-time and flight attendants were very welcoming & friendly which is very unusual for Biman. Hopefully Biman keep this kind of consistency of their quality & service.,Positive,Short Hop!,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
The value for money is good. The flight ticket is cheap but most of the time they never fly on time.,Positive,good,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
It was almost 10:00 PM and raining quite heavily over Dhaka. The pilot approached the runway at a speed much higher than normal. The plane came down with a sharp thud (I'm aware that an abrupt landing is required during wet conditions). Then aircraft veered acutely to the right then sharply to the left. All the while the pilot was struggling to keep plane in a straight line. Thank God we did not skid out of the runway.The airline is never on time. If you have connecting planes with another airline - skip Biman Bangladesh!,Negative,Scary is an understatement!,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
Flight was great but disappoint with the behavior of the cabin crew. They have no manner to talk with the passenger. Their food quality was very good. I was so happy with their food quality. Seat quality was average. Big size flight. But happy that flight was successfully landed in a time.,Positive,Flight was smooth because for the pilot,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"I have experienced Biman's service before and it is not shareable. this time I choose them again for 3 reasons: 1. Heard about betterment of their service from a close friend and frequent flyer, 2. new air craft in Bangkok rout, 3. giving 15% discount on base price using SCB VISA card. Flight was on schedule. aircraft is new one. In flight service is OK. Will travel again.Need to improve food menu seriously.",Positive,Better in few routs,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

First and foremost the through boarding passes were not provided even though my parents had a through ticket but luggage tag was given till Kolkata. On arrival at Kolkata realized luggage was missing and no ground staff at Kolkata could be reached. Finaly through airport staff managed to approach staff of Biman Bangladesh who were clueless and did not bother to assist my parents who are senior citizens. Flight arrived at 7:30pm and yet till almost midnight they were running from one desk to another to get assistance. Through assurance from airport manager they went to a hotel for rest for the night. Next morning they almost missed their domestic flight but managed to catch the same. Finally after 2 days managed to get in touch with Biman Bangladesh officer who was not very helpful but curtly informed that they will send the luggage. After 4 days luggage was finally received. Have sent email to airline but no response nor acknowledgment of receipt of email Also no compensation was offered for the trouble at the airport due to their negligence. Pathetic customer service and experience. Fyi food in the flight was terrible. Regret booking this airline much against the suggestions of many.,Negative,Horrible Customer Experience,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
They are operating ATR from Kolkata ad the service is nothing special and the in flight food is normal and no in flight entertainment.,Negative,Biman,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"In Bangkok I was impressed with the service they were all kind to me and treated me with respect. Then I got to Bangladesh and had a layover. The people in Biman treated me with indifference and then overcharged me for my visa and my hotel, which on each of them they said they would take care of. However the price I paid more for the visa was more than the actual visa, (even the receipt he gave me had a lower price on it) and the hotel was outrageously expensive, especially considering that it was a bug infested hotel (bed bugs, mosquitos and cockroaches). The next day I found myself dealing with indifferent Biman agents. (They treated me with indifference however some individuals from other countries they were downright rude to.) On arrival in Kathmandu we were just flying in circles and circles, which I guess is common for Kathmandu, however there was no announcement made as to why. After 20 min of flying in circles I asked the flight attendant what was going on. She just smiled and said, ""Why would be flying in circles, and walked away."" At that point I thought there was major problems with the plane, but we eventually landed. The landing was the roughest landing I ever had. I heard several people say ""I think there is a problem"". When we stopped there was an applause, we survived. The problem wasn't flying in circles, or the rough landing. The problem was the lack of communication so that we had no idea what was going on.Between corruption of the Biman agents in Bangladesh and the awful plane ride, I will not be flying with Biman again.",Negative,My worst flight,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"The Dhaka airport located in a swamp and as a result is full of mosquitos, both outside and inside the terminal. As a result, the airplanes are full of mosquitos. I could not determine whether or not they are malarial. Any plane flying through Dhaka will have this problem. I will never again fly through Dhaka, or on a plane that has been in Dhaka. The multiple attempts at spraying reduce the quantity only somewhat. This is certainly unacceptable for any flight.",Negative,mosquitos on board,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
I was simply pleased with the improvement done by Biman.Their maintenance was amazing and the 777 was very good to fly with.The food was delicious and in flight services and the entertainment was very good.I suggest people to fly Biman as I was very impressed with my own experience and their quality is improving day by day.The air hostess on board were very kind and helpful and the aircraft was absolutely cleaned including the toilets.I am have also read their reviews in other sites and majority of the people seems to agree with me.,Positive,An Excellent Flight,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

It was our business trip with some other person. In a word it is value for money. Hope to fly with Biman again.,Positive,A business tour,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
I am pleased with the service that they offered. Based upon the price we are paying it is ok. Still the service level can be improved to meet the expectation of all passengers. Different culture and nation expect different level of service. But the food they served is tasty and healthy. Arrival & departure time was maintained.,Positive,Enjoy with simplicity,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"The only advantage is that you can fly direct to Sylhet and that's it.The planes are a big improvement but still poorly maintained during the flight. The toilets are dirty but I blame the passengers for the mess firstly and staff for not cleaning during the flight. Customer service getting better but still poor. Inflight entertainment also getting better but need to keep up to date with the latest movies. Meals are still poor.The return flight back to London is the worse. Most cases they change your flight and force you to stay and terrible hotels overnight. Then you have to do immigration again and the officers are the rudest around and not to mention want ""tips"" to even get a stamp in your passport!",Negative,Still improvement needed,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

But to my surprise the food taste good (or i'm just hungry). What I only like on this flight was the very accommodating, helpful and super nice crews that assist you in every way during and after flight; they are always smiling and asking you if you need something.

Had my cetrizine to ease the itch......mosquiotoes covered every inch of the bus that carried us to the terminal in dhaka. And mosquitoes in the flight. The attendants wouldn't allow us to use the washroom, but they would use it.They would keep seatbelt sign on and prohibit us from using the loo, most of the trip, turbulance was minimal, but the hostess was rude.

Got charged for extra kilo, and also lied by increasing the total amount so they can take more off you. The lady at the desk was very rude and had her hunch men with her making you feel uncomfortable. When you try and express your feelings, they don't want to hear it. You try to argue your case, but they continue to harass you until you give in. This is not good for vulnerable passengers who have health conditions that get worse in situations like this. The staff were not very helpful or understanding, just looking out for themselves on how to make extra pocket money. I ended giving the only bit of cash I had, short of a few taka which they happily took and I received no receipt or nothing so clearly they will just split this amongst themselves.

"I had arrived at Dhaka from Birmingham via Dubai and was destined for Sylhet. I pre arranged my flight for taka 2300 which was excellent value and the airline allowed 40kg baggage. The staff even helped with the luggage and made my transit comfortable. Boarding was easy and when we were seated and in the air, we were given light refreshments. Very nice as I didnâ€™t expect this from a local flight. Flight took 50 minutes and take off and landing was great. On arrival baggage collection was easy and exit was smooth.",Positive,Very good service,US_Bangla_Airlines
It was a good flight and overall service was notable to recommend. They have obviously a bunch of expert pilot and friendly cabin crew. Recently I took couple of flights inside Bangladesh and towards India and I was really happy with their smooth takeoff and landing. There only drawback is they use a lot of dash-8 aircraft for domestic flights and you know how bothering the sound of wing engine. I wanted to suggest them to go for Boeing 737 at least if they really want to keep their clients satisfied for a longer period.,Positive,Good flight with smooth takeoff and landing by an expert pilot,US_Bangla_Airlines
"Despite the recent aircraft crash in Nepal, I chose US Bangla airlines to travel Chittagong duration my trip to Rangamati. It was really nice.

Very poor airlines. The tickets are cheap but The pilots are stressed to fly many flights in a single day. Even the recent crash of US-Bangla Airlines Flight 211 was due to emotional breakdown of the pilot. Fly at your own risk,Negative,Fly at your own risk.,US_Bangla_Airlines
"I have actually lost count of how many occasions I have traveled with this particular airline. In most of the cases, I have found their flight exactly on time.

"I took a round trip flight on a short notice.Price was not cheap, but I needed to reach Dhaka on Friday morning, so it was my only non-stop option.Check in was extremely slow with long lines forming at check inn counter. it's mainly because everyone had so much check in luggage, all were enjoying liberal 40kg check in limit for flight to Dhaka.One gentleman saw me and my wife standing at back of long line with no luggage and called us to a separate counter. he also assigned us to row 3, first row in economy cabin.Plane is old, but well maintained, seats much better than Regent airways. No inflight entertainments. Crew very welcoming, greeted me and my wife at the entrance. Provided us with blankets.Meal service was quite enjoyable, main meal was beef & khichuri, with salad and desert, with coke/sprite followed by tea/coffee. Soft drinks were warm, no ice offered.Flight arrived on time. But the luggage took an hour to arrive, as 3 flights of US-Bangla arrived at the same time so baggage handlers were overwhelmed.On return flight, check in was very smooth in Dhaka, no newspaper given, crew started meal service about 45 minutes in the air, chicken curry with vegetable and pulau was served with salads and rice pudding, coke/sprite and tea/coffee later.Plane reached Singapore on time. Bangladeshi pilots makes the best take off and landings, so smooth...Good airlines, good service, will fly again with them.

"This was not my first time on this route with US bangla. Last time it wasn't bad. Was ok. This time because the AC wasnt working, it became unbearable. While in flight before take off we asked if AC is on n the crew said after take off. Imagine being stuck in a cylindrical tube with 100 ppl and limited air with hot n humid air. It was disgusting. Also during flight AC DID NOT WORK! Also it would help if the air crew were not replaces by human robots. Unprofessional being redefined. Food was below average. Bye US Bangla. Please ensure your passenger satisfaction in the future. ",Negative,Kindly mention the NON AC flight on the bloody ticket!,US_Bangla_Airlines
"Good on-time service. The aircraft is small with only economy class. Seats are somewhat cramped, but since the journey was short, it was fine. Staff are courteous and efficient.

Overall, I would recommend the airline.",Positive,"Punctual, and Good Service",US_Bangla_Airlines

"Flying USB within a week after a tragic incident with this airline was just a wee bit concerning but logic is the opposite. Everything will be well checked and compliant after an incident like this. The flight was uneventful, the food was average, the cabin service ok. Pre flight arrangements at Kolkata was good. However, the luggage arrived at Dhaka Airport almost 35/40 minutes after the flight. I donâ€™t think I can blame that on the airline.",Mixed,I flew Business Class actually,US_Bangla_Airlines
"US Bangla Airlines is good for domestic flights and the best among the other local airlines. But they have to go a long way to reach international standard. On 27th February we were travelling from Dhaka to Kolkata by US Bangla Airlines. The flight was delayed by and hour and half. We were told first that the flight will be late by 30 minutes. But it got more and more delayed and reach to 1 hour 30 minutes. But none of their customer facing personnel indicated about the delay. We had a fight to catch and we could have missed that for them. I along with other few complained for that delay but the response was very horrible. A person told Jet Airlines get delayed very very occasionally. In reply that person told very body very rudely that â€œI know better than you guys whether they get late or not.â€ I am quite frequent in Jet along with other guys. I asked as a customer facing officer can you reply to your customer like thatâ€¦. They again said â€œ I actually know better that you all.â€ I said we should complain about you. He was so boastful that he have his nick name, â€œ Raj is my name and it may help you doing that. How a customer facing team can be like that!!!! He supposed to be assistant manager and most irresponsible person I have ever seen in Airlines servicesâ€¦ Last of all there was not a single word of apology from none of the teamâ€¦ even not from the captain for that delay. This is a formality that is maintained by all.We expect better service to become a good international airline.",Negative,Poor customer facing team specially in airport,US_Bangla_Airlines

Plane was an extended Dash 8. Plenty of room between seats and food was surprisingly good quality especially for a westerner who doesn't like things as spicy as the Banglas do..On the return journey they were flexible with check in and we were able to get the earlier flight which was delayed because of fog in Dhaka.Would certainly fly then again.,Mixed,Good on time service and better than average food.,US_Bangla_Airlines
"Flew US- Bangla for a round trip from Dhaka to Pokhara. Ticket fare was a bit higher as we booked only 10 days prior. The plane was a Bombardier Dash Q300, my first time boarding one. It was nice and comfy, the cabin crew were polite and professional, food was decent. The only downside was no in flight entertainment, not even a magazine. But in such a short flight, may be that was the norm. Well recommended.",Positive,Professional and efficient for a budget airline,US_Bangla_Airlines

"I was coming back with my family after a long Kolkata trip. I was quite happy about the airlines from my experience in Bangladesh. The staffs in the check in counter was really helpful and tried to find best possible sit options for us despite a full house flight. Check in was smooth. However, when we reached the airport we learned that it is delayed for two hours. I was not informed though my email and cell number was given when I purchased the ticket from Dhaka. Inside the airport the announcement was poor. Flight management offered food and beverage to apology for delayed flight but it was not communicated properly. I learned it when we have finished our lunch. Communication need to be improved. Inside the flight seat in front of my wife was broken but it was not noticed by flight attendances or airport maintenance team. The broken seat was almost damaging my wife and daughters' leg. We had to request the other traveler whole time to be cautious. It was bit disappointing as it is a carrier from my country and it was an international flight. Hope these kind of issues will be taken care and monitored properly.",Negative,Need to improve the maintenance inside flight and client communication,US_Bangla_Airlines

Even then the price was competitive.Departure was delayed 30min due to late arrival of few passengers.Aircraft was well maintained, clean, newish looking. Pilot and crew were good, given timely updates on flight progression.After takeoff, newspapers were handed out, followed by wet tissue packet. Meal service consists of main dish (Pulau chicken with vegetables), tiny salad and dessert (rice pudding), bottle of water, then Coke/Sprite, more water then tea/coffee.Luggage allowance was 20kg. Check in was dealt very efficiently and politely.Inflight service was polite as well.

I recently took the flight from singapore to Dhaka. I must say the cabin crew were not sincere to their job.

My full family flew back but i stayed but the crews in the flight was apologizing to my mom for not flying me back home & also were taking a good care of my mom. They also helped my mom with the baggage after landing at Dhaka airport. I came back on the next flight the cabin service is excellent & the timings for this route is the best. the aircraft is a B737-800 new one & also its very cleaned.

The aircraft was old but clean. The take off and landing was superb esp when landing at a wet rainy runway at cox's bazar.The return flight was a bit disapointing, esp by the behavior of the passengers.They were like four crowded lines for boarding and only through one gate.The passengers were behaving ignorantly, esp a man who stood immediately after take off and even when the plane touched on the runway he stood to get his bag as if he was in a bus. Nevertheless it was a good journey and I personally would like to appreciate the skills of the pilot for he flew the aircraft safely through a cyclonic weather.",Positive,GOOD BUT NEED TO IMPROVE the GROUND SERVICE at cox's bazar airport,US_Bangla_Airlines
I've taken multiple flights in Dhaka-Chittagong and Dhaka-Jessore route. Best thing about this airline is number of delayed flights are near to zero. This is the main reason why I'd choose it over any other domestic airline. All the domestic flight durations in Bangladesh are less then one hour; so the in-flight entertainment doesn't really matter. Moderate leg rest and decent food. Staffs are nice and helpful.

"The company needs a LOT of work to improve. I bought 2 tickets using my card and had to cancel one of the tickets as my friend was unable to travel with me. The company Support Line is nearly impossible to get to and once I did get through,they asked me to go to their office to pick up the money. So I did, during my lunch hour. (Side note, the guard outside the office was bullying a street dog WITH A STICK and once I protested he started yelling at me. I complained to the customer service people about him but of course I do not believe that he was reprimanded as they found the entire thing to be quite funny).Anyways, it turned out that my entire trip to the office was a waste of time as they refund card transactions ONLY through online transfers, which is fine, EXCEPT THEY DID NOT TELL ME THIS ON THE PHONE. So I followed their protocol, sent an email requesting a refund and called them to check that they did indeed receive my email. They replied saying that my money will be refunded in 10-15 working days. This was August 2016 (Today is September 28, 2016- just to clarify). I am still to receive this refund and when I called to follow up, (AGAIN, TERRIBLY DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH) they gave me 3 different numbers to call. After going round in this circle, I finally was able to get through to someone who offered to help. He then said that the company never received my email. When I told him of my confirmation email, his response was, ""Oh right.... Um. Sorry madam your request seems to have been overlooked. We will attend to it immediately"". This was a 10 days back. The flight itself leaves a lot to be desired (I've rated it below) but I shouldn't expect too much from a budget airline. Perhaps look into better check-in and boarding services though, that was miserable.",Negative,Very disappointing,US_Bangla_Airlines

"Most people currently avoid their journey by bus on their way to coxbazar , just to avoid the hassle mixed up with traffic jam . I did choose the same . US Bangla didn't keep me waiting for boarding . It does not take more than 40 minutes to reach coxsbazar from dhaka , so i was not expecting any in flight entertainment but the refreshing item (!) and snacks (!) served by them could have been better . Its fair not to serve anything at all than to serve poor quality items . The fare as well as their service is satisfactory .

"Due to my work, I'm a frequent flyer of this route (DHK-COX-DHK). Day by day their air crafts are getting old. Due to lack of proper maintenance and cleanliness, all the seat inside the aircraft is becoming damaged. They even don't bother to clean inside the aircraft before boarding passengers from Cox's Bazar. You can find all the trashes made by the passengers of the last flight surrounding your seat. Their in-flight meal is the most unsatisfactory meal I had in any aircraft. The meal they provide is 01 Plane cake, 01 Chess sandwich and 01 bottle of mineral water. For the last 01 year, they are providing the same menu to all domestic flights. Even I got the same menu in their Kolkata flight also. Their packing quality also looks so cheap, which is a very cheap looking plastic cover. They used to provide ""Fresh"" mineral water, but for the last couple of months, they are providing the mineral water of ""PRAN"" which doesn't go with the brand image of REGENT Airways.

"This was my first flying with a local non goverment airlines. Usually i don't prefer taking bangladeshi non government flight as their reputation isn't good. But I had to take this flight bcz of the scheduling. Their flight from Dhaka leaves at 10.30 am and returns from kolkata at 3.30 pm which is a perfect time to return as the hotel check out time is at 12 pm around the globe. So on our way to Kolkata we boarded the plane 20 minutes before take off, as I have a baby and a wheel chair passenger, we were the last few passengers who boarded the plane but after we get in, we started to feel the heat inside the aircraft. Passengers who boarded 20-30 minutes before us were like boiled already. Everyone was complaining, they were shouting at the cabin crew to switch the AC on. Actually the AC was on, but these are leased aircraft which are 17-18 years old, they don't maintain the aircrafts properly, the consequences is this. Same happened on our way back, same registered aircraft. Passengers were complaining, yawning but they seem to hear any of the passengers and being absolutely careless. Other than that, regent always maintain their schedule, both our flights was time. Served a decent amount of snack even though it was only a 30 minute flight. I would have chosen this flight again but just bcz of the situation due to the AC, i would never fly with regent again.",Negative,No AC on flight,Regent_Airways

If given options, I would have walked to the aircraft, faster, and some exercise, which rich Bangladeshis hate to do and all has big tummy as a result. Boarding was delayed due to bus transport and also because of a sick passenger who can't walk. Regent upgraded the passenger to business class, good job Regent.Aircraft: much newer than the one I used several years ago for SIN-DAC flights.Crew: Nice, greeted me, was helpful.Food: Standard snack box handed out with a bottle of water, it has a cheese sandwich and cake, enough for 30 min flight. Some people complained about heat inside the aircraft till take off, I felt the same. But next day, when I took Singapore Airlines flight back to Singapore, they did the same, turning on AC only after take off.AT CGP: thank God, we were allowed to walk to the terminal, luggage came with in few minutes.Overall: ok for the price, pilot and ground apologised for the delay several time.

"Regent airways is a private airline of Bangladesh with its main hub at hazmat shahjalal international airport Dhaka and secedary hub at Chittagong airport. Although the airline currently serves to regional routes across South Asia, the service is praise worthy and competitive to other airlines.To begin with, the cabin crew are amiable and are easily approachable and professional at the same time. Moreover, the food on economy class is adequate and flavourful as well.The pilots are highly skilled and makes you feel you are at safe hands! To end my review, this airline is passionate about serving its passengers and has earned my respect.I firmly believe regent airways will one day make the Bangladesh aviation scene proud and will carry forward the name of our beloved country bangladesh, Go regent become diligent!",Positive,Excellent service!,Regent_Airways
"On 29 April We were travelling from Dhaka to Saidpur. Due to bad weather we had to start late. The captain informed us that the flight route changed 3/4 times, due to bad weather the flight took Rajshahi route then it crossed border towards kolkata then entered Bangladesh through South Dinajpur. Finally landed to Saidpur safely. Would like to thank Captain and his team for the professionalism they showed.",Positive,Historical Journey,Regent_Airways
"Regent's managed to do it again -- another late flight without any rational explanation (the boarding agent tried to explain ""the weather in Dhaka is not so good,"" while Google tells me it's 78 degrees there and partially cloudy; the more likely explanation is that either the pilot overslept or they've held the plane because some upper-middle class family with a friend in the Regent office is running late).When I first arrived in Bangladesh six years ago, Regent used to be exceptionally reliable with both domestic and international flights, a welcome change from the wholly indifferent customer service of Bangladeshi airlines like Biman. In the past three years, whether through a change in management or just someone in charge allowing things to go steadily downhill, I have just come to expect 30 - 60 minute delays for 45-minute long domestic flights and an hour or more for international flights. My three hour flight to Bangkok today is now approaching two hours of delays with no announcements and likely no justifiable reason.",Negative,Another shoddy experience flying Regent,Regent_Airways

What the heck!!While coming from kathmandu, we were informed the airport that the flight would be delayed for 5hr. While flying from Dhaka to Coxs Bazar, the flight was delayed for 3hr.",Negative,"Never on time, Poor customer experience",Regent_Airways
Over all it was fine. The authority could not manage the luggage timely which costed 30 mins delay to start from Bangkok to Dhaka. There was 40 mins break at Chittagong International Airport.

I would like to thank the airline authority and off course suggest other to board on Regent airlines.,Positive,Returning Bangladesh by Regent,Regent_Airways

"Traveled twice in 2 months. Went to Chittagong from Bangkok in December & returned in January. I have flown with the airline in the domestic routes couple of times in the past. First time I have flown in an international route due to the fact that other than Thai Smile only Regent operates direct flights to CGP (Chittagong) from Bangkok. Flight to Chittagong was pretty decent. There was a delay at the runway, only because there were too many flights waiting to take-off. The 737-700 aircraft was in a pretty good condition from it's outlook. Inside it was somewhat hot. The aircon was unable to provide enough coolness. People were sweating on their seat as the plane waited in the queue to take-off. However, the cabin crew assured us that the aircon will be fine as soon we get airborne! Seats were pretty comfy but not much legroom. You can't expect to have ample legroom in a 737. Liked the interior. Just requires some attention to cleanliness but nothing big.Take-off and landing was smooth. Traditional Bangladeshi food was provided. One thing I have noticed in my both flights, the male flight attendants do not smile at all. Especially for one them I felt like he hates his job! This obviously gave me a bad impression about their cabin service. Out of 4 cabin crew I came to see in my both flights, only one smiled and tried to give a good service. It's not just me, even my wife felt the same. No inflight entertainment. I wouldn't mind as this was just about 2 hours flight. Return flight experience was also pretty much same except the ground service we received is below standard. We had to walk to the Tarmac carrying our hand luggage and there were no lifts in Shah Amanat International Airport to go down to the tarmac from the waiting area at the 1st floor. We had to take the stairs and we had an old lady walking in front us who was struggling to walk down the stair case. No help offered to her from Regent whatsoever. As it was a narrow staircase it took her good 5 minutes to walk down the staircase and people were lining behind her. Felt sorry for her trouble. Same aircon problem in the return flight and food scrap found in the fold up meal tray. To our surprise ""Nasi Goreng"" was provided in meal! While landing at Bangkok, seems like the pilot was in rush to land. Took several sharp turns and the landing was hard. I wouldn't mind flying with Regent again but the attitude of the cabin crew does gives a negative impression. If you want to compete with the other airlines in the region you must improve your cabin service and bring the international standard. I would recommend to fly with Regent but don't expect too much as this is a small airline still trying to strengthen it's feet in the industry.",Positive,Average experience nothing over the expectation,Regent_Airways

"I flew Regent for my first trip to Bangladesh, from Chittagong to Dhaka. Seeing as it was the most efficient and (being a solo female traveller), safest way to get back to the capital, I booked a flight despite some initial reservations. I had a better than expected experience - the seats were comfortable, the flight was smooth and everything really went as planned. One tip for anyone travelling this route - try to travel light as you'll have to walk on the tarmac to get to the plane and climb up. Food-wise, I requested vegetarian food, but didn't get that. So please, any travellers intending to fly domestically, ensure that you have something to eat before flying. Will definitely recommend Regent for a positive experience and am looking forward to my next trip.",Positive,"For a first-time traveller, pretty good!",Regent_Airways

Usually I travel by Regent airways for Dhaka-Kolkata route. They always try to provided good service sometimes not because of the system like delay landing but thy do not forgot to apology. BTW last time i keep my powerbank in my luggage and they keep it in kolkata. I am sorry to say they didn't announce anything like that or it may be my mistake. After 2 days i got my luggage after facing lots of unexpected question. But the interesting part is that when i opened my luggage at home i got an unknown thing looks like inhaler or something in the luggage. Then i called Regent again and they apologize again to keep others packet in my luggage. This is actually called harassment.

"This is a good choice if you're looking for an airline with strong domestic connectivity, especially on the Dhaka and Chittagong route.

It suffers big time with on time performance. Cancellation and long delays are very normal.Leg room: AverageConclusion: If you're flying within Bangladesh, look to travel by Novo Air.

But it was clean and comfortable enough for a short flight of four hours.After take off, there was a loud noise, which crew told me due to air condition system. After a minute, it was ok.News paper was given out after takeoff.Wet towel packet was given followed by food service, main meal of chicken-Pulau and a dessert, small bottle of water, Coke/Sprite and then tea-coffee.Luggage allowance in economy class was a whopping 50kg.Plane reached Dhaka on time, landing was super smooth.Pilot periodically updated about flight progress.

"I regularly fly this airline to Singapore. Have done 4 return trips in the last three months or so. Also did a return trip to Chittagong. All the trips were on Business Class. The main consideration was the competitive pricing and overall value for money. The check in for departure at SATS Lounge in Singapore is a delight and deserves an â€œexcellent. Overall I would have given an excellent rating (food only no entertainment) but the in flight cabin service needs attention. It is inconsistent (some of them are very good) and the cabin crew needs further training. They couldnâ€™t find a place to hang my jacket and the result after a four hour flight was a crumpled jacket which needed immediate laundry service at the hotel for me to wear it to the meeting. Of course cost me a few $s. However, I will recommend Regent Airways with the caveat of flying time of up to 4 hours if the flight is on this aircraft.

They were unable to open the door for half an hour and we really scared. Next two days my wife was suffering with ear pain. We couldnâ€™t enjoy our Holliday. But it was really matter of regrets that the authority didnâ€™t contact with us by any way. I was surprised with their behavior. The aircraft condition was very poor. And the air-condition was not working properly. Stopped traveling with this airline. I would not recommend for next flight.",Negative,"Horrible plane, terrible experience",Regent_Airways

They used to be benchmark among the Bangladeshi airlines. Average for a budget airline but leg space is too much congested. The seats are worn out so not much comfortable needs some changing to the seats. Food quality is above average and service and attitude of the crew was average. It was kind of a long tiring flight for me from Dhaka to BKK since there is a layover in another city. Would opt for direct flight at almost same price next time.,Mixed,Average for a budget airline,Regent_Airways

"I flew with my family from Kolkata to Dhaka, only 40 min hop. The flight was on time and the in-cabin service was ok with some snacks.

And once you are in the plane there are lot of Mosquitoes , and the AC is not working at all, its suffocating in the cabin, since there is no proper air in mid flight even though its a short distance flight since its too hot during summer season particularly in Asia sub continent, and more over the snacks provided are in very cold condition. It seems they are opted 2nd hand planes from Developed countries and running.I even noticed cockroaches in the bathroom area.Traveled multiple times through the same sector but the experience is same, not even know they are managing it. My sincere advice is to fellow travelers is to go for Air India or any other Airways for best experience mainly in this sector.",Negative,Horrible Experience,Regent_Airways
Regent Airways Bangladesh has started operation for the last 4/5 years and now operating several international flights in addition of domestic flights. The flight from DAC to CUU in March was perfectly on time. The new Boeing 737 was perfectly clean. The flight left on time and reached on time.

"Where to begin. Ok, well if you not fussed about a lack of customer service, a void of airline representatives; delays based on fictitious weather conditions â€“ (apparently the information on Apple iPhone is made up) then this is the airline for you. Scheduling is only a mere guideline for this airline, yes the gate does open at 23:00 but actually the plane wonâ€™t be here for another 2 hours. But we will make this into a little game - whereby we wonâ€™t actually tell you any of this information so that you can entertain yourself by running around the airport trying to find it out. Bonus points if you can find one of our representatives. Oh, so you get on the plane (eventually) and make yourself comfortable. Before putting on your seat belt, make sure you roll up the inflight magazine and take swipes at the swarm of mosquitos on board (they were delayed as well but I donâ€™t think they will be compelled to write a review) If you manage to nab a few before take-off, you can continue to entertain yourself for the duration of the flight by gunning for the rest. Good luck on this carrier - your going to need it.",Negative,It would have been better to walk,Regent_Airways
"It was a narrow body 737-700 aircraft which I believe is only viable for domestic routes not for a 2:30 hours journey. Their air conditioning was not working properly.

"I've traveled in this airlines in domestic route (Dhaka - Chittagong and Cox's Bazar - Dhaka).For Dhaka - Chittagong route, my flight was at 8pm. 24 hours before flight departure they informed there was 2 flights at same time. Since their passengers were less, so only 1 flight will be there and our scheduled flight has been changed into another flight. Before 12 hours, they informed us that rescheduled flight will take-off at 9pm (not 8pm).Good part was the rescheduled flight will drop off few passengers in chittagong and pick some from there then this flight will go to Mascot, Oman. So got a bigger plane (boeing) (about 125 seats). originally our scheduled plane was small domestic plane. Food was okay for a short domestic travel.for Cox's bazar to dhaka flight, it was small plane (40-50 seat). Food taste was bad.Flight attendants' service and attitude was good. No flight entertainment (50 minutes flight duration, so it is okay).",Mixed,Average standard airlines,Regent_Airways

"I have used Regent Airways multiple times over the years and I am (mostly) very satisfied with the quality of their service. For a Bangladeshi airlines company, their service is indeed very very good and comparable to many international budget airlines. They lack in-flight entertainment except for newspapers (!) I think! But in this digital age who needs in flight entertainment? I have all the entertainment I need in my pocket (i.e. my mobile phone). They were extremely helpful and courteous with me and my family (1 child and one senior) and they provided service over and beyond what would have been the usual expectation.

Though I am happy because from Bangladesh they are giving opportunities to fly with a reasonable cost.,Mixed,Atleast They Are Trying,Regent_Airways
I have been travelling with them since they started their operations on the route Kolkata-chittagong-Kolkata. Before they used to have small copters which would seat almost 50 people. That was really suffocating and simply a worst experience. People used to bear because no other airlines were there and the ones which were there were not reliable. Now they have started services in the regular aircraft and the experience has bettered. They are majorly on time but sometimes fails to be so as the aircraft which comes to kolkata goes to chittagong and vice versa. The provide some snacks en-route. Can be tried for chittagong as this is the only reliable one.,Positive,Trying to do good in the aviation field,Regent_Airways

My wife and I were unhappy with the size of the bathrooms, I am a large American and she is a 50 kg Rajbari girl, so when we in the bathroom at the same time, ( Don't ask why Bangladesh, will not like the answer) it was loud. When we came out, 20 people were staring at us, and we were so embarrassed. Oh yeah... plane was nice, food was good, left and landed on time...

"This is the second time I have had the pleasure of flying Novo Air and I have to confess I canâ€™t fault the service or professionalism. I booked tickets via their app and initially expected gremlins to sabotage the whole process but to my relief the process was as accessible and reliable as any main contender. The prices do tend to fluctuate or increase depending on when you look at the app but all in all it was totally worth it. I received email and text notifications prior to embarking and this was also useful. I encountered an acceptable 15 minute delay on departure due to adverse weather conditions â€“ better safe than sorry â€“ but other than that no real complaints. The staffs are friendly, bilingual and fully engaging both at check-in and on the plane. I have had some really negative experiences on Bangladeshi flights in the past, many of whom are rude and simply profiteering from peopleâ€™s misery e.g. Bangladesh â€œrip off manâ€ they know who they areâ€¦all in all a very pleasant experience. Yes the designs of the planes are not what we are usually accustomed to but they are clean and reliable and more than adequate for a short hop. I canâ€™t recommend them enough. If however you enjoy the 50 Taka coffee in the departure lounges then Novo Air is not for you, use a different airline so you can spend more time in the lounge to savour the coffeeâ€¦",Positive,Bravo Air,NOVOAIR

" Manchester to Sylhet. One of the worst experiences for my elderly parents. Both aged 80 plus. At the airport it all started. The lady at desk had a sour face on, not giving eye contact or listening, neither checking details properly. There were doctors letters, we had already liaised with the airline, I specifically described their medical needs and they had bracelets to show their claims, conditions etc. All she said was okay. The idea was to provide them with an aisle seat and to be near a toilet to avoid any accidents on the plane that would inconvenience other passengers. The flight was delayed, they were made to sit in the middle in cramped conditions, knee to knee seats causing my parents to suffer with breathing and other conditions. They tried to show the cabin crew the letters and expressed their struggle, but they were completely disregarded and ignored. There's others to consider too, but when it's been prior arranged. You would expect the cabin crews to follow the instructions. Appalling behaviour from Biman Bangladesh Airlines.",Mixed,"""they were completely disregarded and ignored""",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

" London to Sylhet, the service is extremely poor, seat space is very limited. This is not the worst part, when we were returning from Sylhet, we were taken to a hotel with cockroaches in Dacca as it wasn't direct when returning ( I hated this, why do we have to do this unnecessary delays and inconvenience?). According to other passengers, this is normal. We did not sleep. How can they have partnership with a dirty hotel infested with cockroaches, and the food! OMG, what food. For breakfast a boil egg and two slice of bread and no tea. I told them I will skip the breakfast. You are not allowed to come out of the hotel, I felt worst then a prisoner. Inside the plane, dirty toilets, staff don't even bother cleaning.",Negative,"""service is extremely poor""",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
" My husband and I travel every year in BB during winter from Heathrow Airport, London as its the only airline which flies almost direct to Dhaka. We have usually enjoyed out flights due to the service of the young cabin staff. However this time we went again in June 2019 to attend a wedding. The return flight from Dhaka to London was a nightmare on 30 June 2019. I was in seat 2J. The stewardesses were very rude and unhelpful and were busy taking selfies with a rude passenger in the front row (Aisle seat) on our side. He was using his telephone continuously during takeoff and as the cabin staff did not do anything, my husband and I complained to the cabin staff to stop him without success. They appeared to be in awe of that male passenger. The main dishes were spicy and substandard as usual so I requested for sandwiches which was never a problem in previous flights. They ignored my request and so I waited for the cheese, crackers and fruit trolley. They passed us by asking if we wanted any drinks. I was starving in Business Class! My husband requested one of the stewardesses to bring cheese, crackers and fruit for me. She brought thick slices of cheese and some fruit without crackers and practically placed the plates with a bang in front of me. Try eating thick slices of cheese without a knife and crackers!!!! They did not serve any thing else after the so called lunch on a 13 hour flight in Business Class. My husband asked for some food as we were both hungry and we were given some stale cupcakes which we could not eat. Finally they brought some really inedible food before we landed. Thank God we had a real good meal waiting for us at home. This is the service in Bangladesh Biman in Business Class. There is no first class. We only travel in BB as we have no choice. British Airways used to have wonderful direct flight from London to Dhaka but they stopped it for some reason. How we wish they were back! I have the boarding card but unable to upload it now. without help!",Negative,"""return flight was a nightmare""",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
" I was travelling from London to Chittagong. I had to wait in Dhaka for our flights to Chittagong. It was an awful experience as our flight was delayed by 8 hours. To make things worse, there were no information about the flight and I could not find any Bangladesh Biman staffs to inquiry about our flight. It was my 14 year old daughters first journey to Bangladesh but unfortunately it was extremely unpleasant at Dhaka airport. We also took a domestic flight to Dhaka from Chittagong and that flight was hour and half late,our flight to Sylhet from Dhaka was an hour late. On our way back, flight from Sylhet was hour late to Dhaka and 30 minutes late to London. In our London flight, our meal wasn’t eatable, salad went off and smelled really bad.

" Yangon to Kathmandu via Dhaka. Easily the worst airline I've ever flown. I've been to 50 countries, flown on dozens of different airlines, and even worked for one myself. It took them two hours to help me at the transfer desk. They were extremely rude, didn't know what they were doing, and spoke very little English. Plane itself was very bare bones and the flight attendants couldn't speak English. In flight meal was the worst I've ever had. Fly another airline if you can. Time for the Bangladeshi government to shut down this failed venture and let the private sector take over. It literally couldn't be any worse.",Negative,"""worst airline I've ever flown""",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
" London to Dhaka  via Sylhet. Overall, not a good experience. Crew needs intense training on service. Couple of young ones were close to standard but senior staff were not even close from being standard. Food quality was really bad, drinks were okay. Probably will fly with Biman again because of patriotism knowing that service will be below standard. In flight entertainment should be updated frequently, not many interesting choices were available. For transit passengers they had no information available at Heathrow, that was really dumb. It appeared to me as if no one evaluates their performance. Sad.",Negative,"""not a good experience""",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

It has no tissue, it was clean but no tissue. However, happy to use Biman again.",Mixed,"""happy to use Biman again""",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
London to Sylhet. Check-in: There is no online check in system. As a family (with young children) we had pre-booked seats. At the Heathrow counter when I checked in they put three of us in three different seats and said because of some regulation (Front of aeroplane loaded with cargo) they have to put as many passengers towards the rear end and it's not possible to provide the seats together not even reserved ones. They suggested to talk to crew once the flight reaches the cruising altitude. When spoke to crew they didn't want to listen and understand. The crew members were least helpful and don't have any customer service skills. They are walking and eating their food before they serve the passengers. The food quality was poor and fixed menu. They don't have any vegetarian options and difficult to provide any dietary requirements. The seat comfort is close to nothing. The local buses in UK have comfortable seats compared to the Biman seats. 75% of inflight entertainment was broken. Fortunately I took my kids tablets or else the 11 hour flight would have been nightmare. There is no phone charging facility or wifi to purchase. The temperature was getting either too cold or too hot. They don't switch on the aircon before take off. I travelled with Biman after 16 years and I am a frequent flyer in different airlines. But this is probably the first and last time I will travel with them. The price of the tickets doesn't reflect the service they provide. They are not particularly any cheaper than other airlines.,Negative,"""seat comfort is close to nothing""",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
Bangkok to Dhaka. This is the worst management ever. There is no announcement of delays and the reason said afterward is that because of a VIP.

" I reached Dhaka from Delhi at 3 pm and my flight to Chittagong was at 7 pm. I went at 5pm to the counter to check in. The customer services people told me very curtly to come back at 6pm. When I went at 6pm, they said the flight was delayed by one hour. The personnel were busy lazing around, eating something in no uniform. Later when I went back to the counter they said there was a further delay. There were no announcements. This went on and on and finally the flight left at 10pm. I later came to know from others that this a regular situation with Biman Bangladesh airlines. For my return, I promptly cancelled my Biman flight and took a local one. The other private airlines are not listed on the web when we make the booking. So if you are planning to travel, then search for Novoair, US Bangla or Regent airways. Apparently, these are much better. I returned by US Bangla which was quite good.",Negative,"""There were no announcements""",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
" Biman charges half of what renowned carriers charge for round trip Business Class fares between London and Dhaka through their hubs. Keeping that in mind and the fact that there is no change of aircraft required for this trip by Biman, you get a decent offering overall. B777-300ER aircraft is my favourite. Business Class cabin with 35 angle flat seats in a 2-3-2 configuration. Large PTVs with AVOD in Bangla, Hindi and English. Bilingual flight tracker provided. Some audio with Indian Classical Music would complete the package which included games for children. Decent headphones, blankets and pillows. Amenity kit consisted of eye shades and socks only. Plenty of food choices. Second service was as substantial as the first. However, presentation of the meal service was awful. FAs needed to remove all plastic and foil wraps from serving dishes, and neatly arrange the meal tray before bringing it to the passengers. Being a dry airline, Biman needed to excel in its soft drinks service. Fruit juices of very poor quality and quantity. I expect larger glasses with bigger servings and refills without having to ask. Orange should taste like freshly squeezed in Business Class. Regular black tea served was of very poor quality. FA should never simply dish out coke and sprite cans to Business Class passengers. Such drinks should be served in glasses (with optional ice) brought from the galley. FAs consisted of two ladies and two gentlemen (one being the purser). The ladies did all the work while the men loitered around the galley. The female FAs thus struggled to perform their duties and then go above and beyond with any personal touches like asking about extra drinks or food. Such personal touches were completely missing. The ladies looked fantastic in their sari uniforms. The men had poor personal grooming with tired looking outfits. Male FAs need to have fresh new South Asian inspired uniforms and training in better grooming and appearance. Lounge access was provided at the beginning of both trips. Mildly scented hot towel and newspaper provided upon taking seats. Juice provided to welcome everyone. The airline caters quite well to a Bangladeshi clientele. Much more needs to be done in terms of beverage service if to attract more international travellers.",Mixed,"""Much more needs to be done""",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
" Kathmandu to Dhaka Business Class. Figured we would pay the extra to fly Business Class and it was the best decision ever! Check-in by a new agent so it took some time but bags tagged with Biz Class tag and given access to the lounge at KTM airport. Nice food spread and drinks, just no views of the airport. Went through security and it's a mob-scene at the gates. Many flights leaving at the same time (early afternoon) so it was hot and crowded. Boarded by bus to the plane and welcomed by the flight attendants graciously. Excellent service - one of the best flights ever. Row 1 A/B - massive amounts of leg-room on a leased 737-800. FA's apologized as their own 737-800s have in-seat video, but we didn't mind. The service from boarding to deplaning was second to none. We were the only passengers in Business. Take off gave amazing views of Kathmandu, and to our luck the route took us along the Himalays and we had fantastic views of Mt. Everest!  Meal was delicious served on china with plentiful drinks provided. The FA's talked with us about what to see in Dhaka on our short visit there and kept us entertained on the flight. Landed a bit late and bags came out quickly after getting our visa on arrival. Really enjoyed Biman - and would like to fly them long-haul and see how they are in the 777-300 Biz class",Mixed,"""Really enjoyed Biman""",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
" Dhaka to Kuala Lumpur. This was my worst journey ever. My flight was supposed to be at 9:15 am. So I arrived at the airport. First impression came while getting my boarding pass. There was no systematic organisation in the booth, the lines were all haywire and since there was no barricade people were just dodging in between the lines. The flight was then delayed to 2pm. Lets agree to the accept the delay, but by now I have decided never to use this airlines. What provoked me to give this review was that the flight was further delayed to 4pm.

" London to Dhaka via Sylhet with Biman Bangladesh. Flight attendants were caring and friendly with no fake smiles. Economy cabin laid out in 3-3-3 seating configuration in economy which was a plus point due to wider seats. Beverage service consisted of one or two types of juice, coke or sprite with no real choices offered. Stingy in servings. They served you whatever they felt like. Main dish in the dinner service consisted of Bangladeshi curries with multiple choices (chicken, fish and vegetarian) which were unknown to most passengers. No menus provided. They served you the meat one assuming that is what you wanted. Tea and coffee served in very small portions. Portions of main dish needed to be increased and accompaniments like salad needed to be bigger and more imaginative. Plastic cutlery and paper cups were cheap. AVOD entertainment provided in seat back PTVs. Bengali entertainment was accompanied by Bollywood, Hollywood and American popular culture. Kids had games to play and moving map was provided both in Bangla and English. Breakfast before landing in Sylhet was very filling. Majority of passengers disembarked in Sylhet availing themselves of a convenient 9:30 minutes journey home from London. Small snacks provided on the 25 minute flight to Dhaka.",Positive,"""friendly with no fake smiles""",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
" Dhaka to Toronto via London. My 21 hour trip took me 45 hours only because Biman Bangladesh was 2 hours late and I along with 9 others missed the connecting Air Canada flight from London. Their response at the service desk was ""go home"" and ""the next flight is 17 hours away, you are responsible to book the flight, and since you cannot stay inside the airport, you have to find your own accommodation"". When me and the other passengers started to talk about rights as a passengers, then they supposedly booked the flight, and after further arguement they agreed to provide accommodation. The Biman agents at the check in was really rude. Their comment was ""Biman is always late, I don't understand why other airlines gives us as connecting flight."" Well that's because Biman never posts their delayed time online. If Biman is always late, I don't understand why not just adjust the schedule. There was an unannounced transit of an hour in Sylhet, where the cleaning crew stayed cleaning with vacuum while the passengers were on the plane. Put the blankets in a garbage bag and shoved the bag in the washroom floor with their feet. The inflight food and entertainment was terrible. But that's not a deal breaker for me since I prefer to sleep anyway.  In summary, you can always depend on Biman to be late, be treated as if they are doing you a favour, and the only thing I heard and agree with is ""never again with Biman"".",Mixed,"""depend on Biman to be late""",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
" My flight from Dhaka to Thailand in Business Class was average. I like travelling by Biman but maybe that is because I haven't experienced delays as much and I was lucky that way. However, I wouldn't pay to be on Biman's Business Class. This flight was bought for me so I did not care too much, but for those of you who are considering paying for Business Class, please consider the following points: 1) You will not enjoy the in-flight entertainment system that they have. I played 'Dolly Parton' the whole flight as I couldn't find a better option. 2) The interior of the cabin (starting from the lounge) will make you feel like you have traveled back in time to the 70s. Even the china used for the flight somehow feels very old and not in a classy vintage way. 3) The food was very average. The prawn salad tasted bland. Whoever the chef was did not do a good job with it. They could have done a better menu. The food served in economy class on my way back from Thailand tasted much much better. 4) The hot towels served during the flight lacked moisture. They just handed out warm dry towels which was pointless. Luckily, it was a short flight and being a clear day, I could look down and enjoy the sight below. Otherwise I would have been bored out of my wits. Good points: 1) It was spacious and the seats were not so bad. 2) The service provided by the staff was nice. 3) The dessert that they served was excellent.",Mixed,"""flight in Business Class was average""",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

Staff look like they would rather be doing something else rather than working. Food was terrible, served soft drinks in paper cups so you aren't able to ask for anything but water during non meal times.

IFE was reasonable. Meals could have been better. Check-in at Singapore was ok. Cabin crew was also ok. The baggage took a long long time to arrive at Dhaka. Dhaka to Chittagong operated by Boeing 777-300 was delayed by 3 hours. Quite frustrating wait at the domestic lounge, where the only snacks stall had run out of food.

"Very disappointed with the Biman Bangladesh Airlines Boeing 777-200 it was so bad. It was like you go back to the 70's. I have travelled with Biman previously with the newer Boeing 777-300 and that was so much better experience. This experience was bad - seats were cramped zero entertainment and for 10 hours it was very painful not worth money you pay. Return trip was even worse as previously they kept you in hotel for one night in Dhaka, than fly next morning, but now you have to go Sylhet airport for 3am stop at Dhaka, wait there 4 or 5 hours than fly UK.

"The planes used by Biman Bangladesh from London to Sylhet and return via Dhaka were clean and cabin in good condition. I believe the planes used for the journey were Boeing 777-300ER. The  the Inflight Entertainment has a 12"" screen, with Hollywood and Bollywood Movies, games, flight maps and other information. The seats in economy were comfortable and included foot rests and neck support, and the inflight magazine was also good. Food The food served was not to the standard of Emirates or other similar airlines, but still to a good standard. The food consisted of two main meals, cold drink and hot drink. Cabin crew were attentive and smiling and spoke fluent English. They cleared trays promptly and responded to requests promptly. They even brought my group of travellers masala (desi) tea's upon request. There is improvement needed in the way that they serve food. During the main meal serving times, there are 3 option ie Chicken, Lamb and Fish, however this is not advertised anywhere and nor is there a menu card offered, which is offered by other airlines. The only reason I found out was because I enquired about the options, otherwise cabin crew simply serve the dish they hold in their trolley!

"First flight with Biman Bangladesh Airlines after almost ten years of not flying with them due to terrible planes and flight scehdules. Check in at Heathrow was chaotic as there were many travellers with families and overweight luggage. Biman don't have their own lounge but use Gulf Air at Heathrow. worth paying 30 pound surcharge for some peace and relaxing. New plane had good seats and clean interior. Inflight entertainment is okay, not a great selection of movies of videos but sufficient. Meals were adequate though nothing special and certainly not on par with the Emirates or Qatar Airways. Biman seems to have made some improvements from what it was, but there are still negatives. Cabin crew really need to smile more and be friendly, they seem disengaged as if they don't like their jobs. Selection of soft drinks is very poor - asked for coke and not available, asked for pineapple juice again not available. They do not offer drinks during flights or pre take off. They don't provide hot towels and you have to ask for blankets.",Mixed,"""there are still negatives with Biman""",Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

Amazingly both the flights were perfectly on time. In fact both of those did not even slipped 10 minutes. I heard that Biman Bangladesh improved a lot in terms of schedule service inflight audio visual entertainment but the experience was beyond expectations. A good number of recent Hollywood movies classic English Hindi and Bengali films were available on international flight with no extra charge. Complementary food was excellent.

Flew from Heathrow to Dhaka on 6th July 2014. Checking-in at Heathrow Terminal 4 was an unusual experience for me. Although checking-in was relatively quick but the chaos/arguments amongst the passengers and ushering staff didn't go unnoticed. No niceties. This chaos and disorganisation continued during the boarding. Take off delayed but that was of no fault of the airline. Aircraft Boeing 777-/300 ER was fine. In-flight food was simple usual Asian curry and rice and not much to say about that. Cabin crews didn't seem very happy. They portrayed the image of doing a job rather than serving customers with a smile. Full of used toilet tissues on the toilet floor and on one occasion I found no toilet paper at all. Landed at Sylhet International Airport. The airport is a joke for international standards. Passengers for Sylhet got off and few cleaners boarded and followed by few domestic and international passengers bound for Dhaka. Biman then took off for Dhaka (a 20 minutes flight). The captain didn't even bother to announce anything! Confusion again after landing at Dhaka airport. Which passengers will use which door! No organisation no clear instructions no communications between crews. They just stood by the door arms folded. Returned to London Heathrow on 13th August in business class wasn't that bad. This time the cabin crew were more welcoming. Take off was delayed 45 minutes and landed at Heathrow at 4.05 instead of 3.30.,Negative,Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"We have just returned from a 2 week trip to Dhaka. 5th April LHR-DAC delayed 3 hours. When a crew was finally aboard the lack of discipline amongst the passengers scrambling to get on as if it was going to depart without them delayed the fight still further. On this flight the cabin crew were fairly miserable but not as bad as some we have seen. The cabin lights which are normally dimmed for take off were not switched on again for more than half an hour into the flight. IFE was not switched on until around 1 hour into the flight - why I cannot understand. Of course the scheduled turnaround in ZYL for onward to DAC was a joke in terms of timing as around 400 people trooped slowly off with their children and around another 300 trooped in for onward connections. Arrived in DAC about 4 hours overdue. Return flight direct DAC-LHR started with a drama. Arrived DAC to check in and were met by a check-in desk operator who seemed puzzled and asked us to wait as there was a problem. After 15-20 minutes of 3-4 check in desk staff discussing this animatedly over a console we were approached by a more senior check in operator who bluntly told us ""You are not on this flight"". Eventually a younger member of the group pointed out to them that we were not stand-by passengers and that we had a confirmed booking. However by this time someone had reallocated our seats. Eventually we received boarding passes. Flight was on time and had a newly recruited crew who were helpful smiled and even chatted. This flight DAC-LHR had a 12 year old allocated to the exit row 6 on one side of the cabin and a 6 year old and an elderly overweight lady in the equivalent row on the other side - more chaos for the cabin crew to sort out after boarding. If this airline wants to survive it needs to drag itself into the 21st century and stop running a Cattle Class service with updated training in customer services and a bit of humanity - especially the ground crews.",Negative,Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
LHR-ZYL. ZYL-DAC-LHR. Flying with Biman for the first time was a great experience. Outbound flight LHR-ZYL departed 10 mins early. Aircraft was Biman's 3rd new Boeing 777 300ER (S2 AHM / Akash Prodeep) which was only 1 month old and was completely fresh inside out. Colour of the seats was a bit dreary but was comfortable with plenty of legroom. Staff were nice and friendly but a some of them need to smile a bit more. Food was excellent. Inbound flight from ZYL to DAC was delayed by 2 hours. Plane was in good nick which was Bimans first B777 (Palki). DAC-LHR was Bimans 2nd Boeing (Arun Alo) which was also pretty much clean until a few hours in to the flight were the toilets became a mess. I would definitely fly with Biman again when I travel to Bangladesh as it only takes 9.5 hours rather than 15 hrs should I have used another airline which requires changing aircraft's.,Mixed,Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

"Dhaka - Kathmandu - Dhaka. This was the only airline going directly from Dhaka to Kathmandu. Outbound was on time but the plane was an old Fokker which should have been scrapped years ago. There was no electricity in the kitchen and we were server a cold ""vegetarian burger"". Going back a few days later the plane was delayed for 6 hours for no reason. Once we landed in Dhaka it was 3 am instead of 6 hours earlier at 9 pm. No explanation no excuse no suggestion of free of charge airport shuttle was given. Nothing.

Flew from Dhaka to London in October with new Boeing 777 on business class. To be honest wasn't that bad but they do need to look after their Business class passengers a bit more. Plane was new and entertainment was alright most movies are outdated by least by 6+ months. Foods were okay just to fill you up I found Qatar Economy food even better then Biman Business class. A lot of leg room only thing I hated was when the announcement was made for economy class not to do this and that it was broadcast throughout the plane. Overall I will fly again.,Mixed,Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
DAC-DXB August 18th. Shockingly expensive for quite poor product. Biman Business Class is without a doubt the most affordable upgrade all over the world (USD 400 for one way ) however you get what you pay and it's evident that such a service is less than EK economy class which was USD 60 cheaper: poor old and tired lounge at Dhaka airport not less old and tired Airbus A310 as an equipment (which was continuing to Rome afterwards). No IFE on board cheesy breakfast served (burnt fried egg cold kangee strange chicken sausage and sautéed mushroom tasting like sponge) and no espresso coffee available. Rude and unprofessional Bengali cabin crew. Definitely fly Emirates on DAC-DXB route.,Negative,Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
Due to no seats being available with Singapore Airlines I unfortunately had to fly from Singapore to Dhaka with Biman and so I at least booked Business Class. Flight delayed almost 4 hours without explanation and very little communication from ground crew. Flight crew were reasonably attentive but they really do need to learn to smile. The food was OK but certainly not Business Class standards and they had a very limited selection of drinks and on-board entertainment (not everyone wants to watch Bollywood movies and the screens were too small). The A310 aircraft was reasonably clean but really starting to show it's age. The toilets were a mess by the end of the flight even though it was less than 5 hours duration. Really the only good point was the price i.e. Business Class ticket was half the price of an Economy ticket with Singapore Airlines. I certainly won't be flying Biman again unless I have no other choice.,Mixed,Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
Heathrow - Sylhet. Departure delayed an hour passengers created chaos as they fail to listen to instructions given by cabin crew. Cabin crew themselves need to smile more especially the female cabin crew. Overall the new B777 is comfortable and entertainment is decent. Food is served twice but the quality could be improved found the food to be quite bland. Sylhet airport itself is a joke that itself is a different topic altogether. Overall for the price I paid I am fairly happy with the service.,Mixed,Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"Jan 2013. Heathrow - Sylhet return. Departure delayed 4hrs on flight out to BD. New 777 pleasant enough toilets kept clean and food served twice. Cabin crew very attentive. Return flight Sylhet - Dhaka delayed by over 3hrs (got asked to be at airport for 4.30am. Flight left at 10.30am). Delay due to ""fog"". Dhaka - Heathrow. Plane pleasant enough food edible. Not enough entertainment. No cartoons for children and very un-accommodating cabin crew. I flew with a 4yr old and 13month old and no baby cot was provided although specifically requested at check-in desk. Will not choose Biman in future. Although baggage allowance and direct flight is appealing the overall delays and service make me think I'm better off with an Emirates or Etihad next time.",Negative,Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"CCU-DAC-CCU. My flight to Dhaka was scheduled for 1930 hrs and since I was connecting from an Indian domestic flight I had arrived at Calcutta Airport at noon time. Sitting in the lobby of the international terminal I received a phone call from Biman informing me the flight would be delayed until 2230 (although the departure information board right above me was still showing ""Scheduled""). To their credit BG offered free dinner. We finally departed 2330 i.e. 4 hours late. Can't understand why an airline whose main base is only 40 minutes flying time away cannot rearrange its planes to avoid a 4-hour delay. Returning four days later flight was on time but check-in was extremely slow due to repeated incursions by uniformed staff holding bundles of tickets and passports of pax who were not in the queue. When I finally complained the staff member in question told me that he was actually checking in himself ""as crew"" and therefore had priority. Further questions revealed that he was not operating crew and simply felt that paying passengers come last in the scheme of things.

I was travelling with my three children aged 20 months 3 years old an 8 year old and my mother from Heathrow. My flight was for 3pm but was delayed until 9pm. My return flight from Shylet was for 10.40am and was then delayed to 3.00pm. Once we arrived in Dhaka the flight was for 2.00am but then delayed again for the following morning but there was no time given. This carried on for the next 5days. No information was given throughout these days and I was running out of money as I had two children on nappies I did not have enough clothes or enough nappies. I asked for nappies and they supplied me with 6 pieces of nappies after 8hrs.Two of my children were due back for school and as a result of this they both missed 1 week of school. My family and I were put up in the Imperial Hotel International for five days with no explanation as to what was happening. We were only told that a connecting flight would be available the next day. This went on for five days. I always made contact with the people who was in connection with those in charge as we was left in a situation not knowing when where going to get our flight. We then was put on a flight on the 5th day with the airline Air India to the Uk. We were given no financial or practical assistance or information from Biman Bangladesh as to what was happening and were left stranded with a young family for five days in a strange city. The situation would have been extremely stressful for anyone in my position however for my mother and me it was even more so as she suffers from high blood pressure and I am epileptic.,Negative,Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
London -Dhaka-Sylhet recently. When we arrived at LHR it took over two ours to check in due to long queues. We were then told our flight was delayed but not told the reason for the delay or how long we would have to wait. Our flight ended up being delayed for 12 hours and it was a complete nightmare in the airport with two boys running around all over the place. After this ordeal we boarded the aircraft at midnight. I was appalled by the poor service dished out by Biman cabin crew. They were curt and less then helpful when I asked them for anything and avoided making eye contact. They made no effort whatsoever to make us comfortable. On the way back the journey was no better. Although we had prebooked to arrive by the last flight from Sylhet to Dhaka so the transit time before we boarded the plane for London would be shorter we were made to take the first flight to Dhaka when the tickets were reconfirmed. When we arrived in Dhaka it took over two hours of immigration checks and queues before we were taken to a hotel. Staff in Dhaka airport were completely oblivious to the needs of parents with young children. I had to stand in ceremony in front of countless officials who made us wait obscene lengths of time before they even noticed us. We were finally taken to a Hotel - it must have been one of the worst Hotels in Bangladesh. The four of us were ushered into a dark and dirty room with no windows or natural day light. The furniture was shoddy and falling apart carpet was stained blanket on the bed was filthy. On the flight back the service from the cabin crew was no better. By then I ceased to be appalled by anything because it is the norm with Biman Bangladesh airlines.,Mixed,Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
I recently flew with Biman accompanied by my 20-month old son from London to Dhaka to Sylhet. There was delays when boarding delays at Dhaka even though my flight was a direct one from London to Sylhet. During the night I was ignored by crew members despite my repeated requests for a blanket for my child. I eventually had to cover him with part of my sari to keep him warm. The toilets were filthy mother- &-baby changing facilities could not be found anywhere on the plane despite their notice being hung on a so-called baby-changing room. The crew were unhelpful and rude. At check-in in London I was told by a Biman representative to pay a 'reward' for the baggage handler to ignore my so-called overloaded baggage - which was NOT above the allowed weight! The food and service provided on board was shoddy to say the least. The plane was falling to bits seats and food trays did not stay where they were meant to a child seat belt had to be requested repeatedly by myself as crew members did not bother to check whether passengers had belted up. On the return journey I did not even bother asking for one - the hassle was too much. The most horrendous thing about Biman is that there is a serious lack of responsibility for passenger safety by crew members. This is quite frightening when travelling with young children. The return journey was very disorganised as we were required to reconfirm already confirmed tickets and once were contacted by their office to say the flight was delayed and to collect a new boarding pass which we had to pay for with our funds.,Negative,Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines

Riyadh to Dhaka and back - my second time. After the many delays and poor service at the counter (one advantage being that if your vacation is very short you have it extended by the delays and you can blame it on the plane to dodge your superior's wrath!) I was in a queue for over 3 hours just to get through immigration! I finally boarded the plane which was parked way out on the tarmac and got there by the bus shuttle service. Was winter so I was spared the heat (this flight didn't have very good air-conditioning I think it was one of the older planes) but it can get quite stuffy. The cabin crew quite friendly and chatty. The seats had very little legroom even for my 5’6 frame. I had to push the neighboring passenger off my shoulder - thrice well we really can't blame him the seats didn't recline and were cramped. Food was ok considering I’ve tasted worse. Toilet seats were bad and lets not forget the train of ants on the toilet wall; I saw tiny roaches crawling on a another flight! I received my luggage 2 days after I reached Dhaka. I had some clothes and personal amenities in my carry-all so I survived - but most of the other people on my flight were not so lucky... If your traveling in winter and it's one of the newer planes at night I suggest you keep your outerwear as it can get quite chilly (provided there is air conditioning)  and blankets are in short supply. On one of my flights most people had turned in their jackets which were kept in a compartment behind the projector screen there weren't enough blankets to go around and so many people shivered mercifully children were given priority as for myself I had my jacket on - a cabin crew member suggested holding on to it - thanks to her. Well it's a very small fleet and so I guess not too much in the way of funds. As to whether I'll ever fly it again I don't know but in the mean time I'll put it on my list of airlines I'd fly only out of dire necessity.,Negative,Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
I guess I can only echo the complaints below and be thankful that I made it back to London in one piece. Journey to Bangkok uncomfortable and delayed for only 10 hours - (I understand now that this really is a walk in the park when flying with Biman). Return journey was not so smooth - after spending two days trying to reconfirm my already paid for tickets and finally giving up I was allowed to fly from Bangkok to Dakar. Bad mistake - why didn't they leave me in Bangkok where you can organise things normally - alas my path had been chosen - I was to land in Dakar and get told that I am not allowed to leave - great - its not like I have a job to go to and I could think of nothing better to do than spend the rest of my days rotting away in possibly the worst airport in the known world. 9 hours of hard negotiation a call to the British Embassy and some serious negotiation with the London office meant that I was able to board the flight 9 hours later with only 20mins to spare. If this had not happened I would have been trapped in Dakar for between 3-5 days. I am not a religious man but I must admit I was praying with everyone else at takeoff when I saw the decor and found a piece of the plane (not sure which) under the seat in front of me - I carefully replaced this and tried to forget that I ever saw it - an unscheduled stop in Dubai (clearly to drop off all the passengers that they had over booked onto all the already paid for tickets) meant the flight from Dakar to London took 17 hours - match this with a non-reclining seat - air stewards smoking on a non-smoking flight and distinct uncertainty if we were going to make it made for an experience I will never forget. Long live Biman since my return you have made me appreciate every minute of every day that I am still here.,Negative,Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
"New Delhi to Dhaka: without doubt the worst airline I've ever flown. On a scale of 0-10 with 0 the worst and 10 the best Biman rates -10. My check-in experience was horrendous. There was no order or organization and the process took over an hour - a good thing the flight was running a few hours late. I had to fight to keep people from cutting in line in front of me. The staff didn’t seem to know what they were doing and there didn’t seem to be enough staff. The excess baggage fee was highway robbery - I checked two bags and paid just over $125. And they don’t take credit cards. I was thankful that I had kept my Indian rupees so that I was able to pay the huge excess baggage fee. I can understand a shop in remote village not taking VISA but not an international airline. Their handling of cash would give an accountant a coronary. Make sure you keep good records of what you pay and who you give your cash to. I would have sworn that the antique looking Airbus 310 I flew Delhi to Dhaka was built back in the 19th century - never cleaned or maintained since. The unusual mechanical noises during taxi take off flight and landing were unnerving. The seats are small and tightly squished together - pity anyone taller than me (I'm 5'10"") I have no idea where they will put their legs. I was struggling to find someplace to put mine - heaven forbid if the passenger in front of you decides to recline back into your lap and face. I doubt I could have read a book on the flight. There wasn't room for one! Plus the pages would have burst into flames due to the extremely hot temperature inside the cabin (I had a thermometer with me) it was over 91 Fahrenheit (33 Celsius) and there was no air circulation which made it seem even hotter. If you don't have any natural padding don't expect to find any in the seats. And pray you don't have to use the restrooms during the flight. Many have over the years and most seem to have missed their target. After landing I really expected to look back (as if I could really see though the filthy dirty windows) and see wing parts debris one of the engines and all our luggage spread out behind the aircraft as we taxied roughly off the runway. After arriving in Dhaka only two and a half hours late I hoped my return flight would be better. But after reading the negative comments on this web forum I didn’t have much hope for a better flight back to Delhi. I just hoped I would survive! And a recent article in the local paper about Biman flights experiencing 50 hour delays in New York and multi day delays in Europe didn’t encourage me any. If anyone ever suggests that you fly on Biman walk instead. If you arrive at your destination you will be required to reconfirm your return flight at least 72 hours before your flight or your confirmed ticket will be canceled. That may be good or bad depending upon your perspective. Reconfirmation is another huge hassle with Biman. It took me six tries; once by phone as stated on their web site and twice at their office in Chittagong and I tried again without success at a travel agency. The lines at the Biman office were long and not moving maybe they had staff working the counters and maybe not it was hard to tell looking through the multitudes of people waiting in the dark room. I ran out of time during both attempts at the Biman Chittagong office and had to leave. When I got to the Chittagong airport I went to the Biman ticket counter and they couldn't reconfirm my ticket there. Finally a local friend spent several hours getting my return ticket reconfirmed for me in Dhakha. I don't see the logic of having to reconfirm already bought and paid for confirmed tickets. My return flight went better than my first one did. My experience at the check out counter went well. I thought it was interesting that my excess baggage fee was less than half what I paid on my first flight considering that I had a few more kilograms on this flight. The flight left on time and arrived on time in Delhi. I had some friends who flew from Mumbai to Dhaka the other day and their flight was fourteen hours late. The aircraft was an old DC-10 and this flight was not stuffed full. In fact I had an open seat next to me which gave my legs someplace to spread out to. The food was not as tasty as the first flight but so far I’ve not gotten sick. The cabin temperature was comfortable only during take off and landing. During flight the air temp was around 85 Fahrenheit (30 Celsius) without any air circulation still way too hot for my taste. I didn’t brave the restroom on this flight. I don’t plan to fly with Biman again. The hot cabin temp very tight seating space excessive excess baggage fees and the reconfirmation hassles are enough to keep me off their planes in the future. Seriously fly on another airline when you visit Bangladesh. The few dollars saved with Biman Bangladesh Airlines are not worth it.",Mixed,Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
I never thought an airline could be this pathetic. Missed my Emirates connection from Dubai to Dhaka and put onto the Biman flight. Unreal! Lavatory doors broken - in the open position total seat fixed in place by many coats of paint last owner was spanish as all the signs etc were in that language (as though the Bangladesh passengers understood it)  excrement on the floor no air movement inside the cabin told to pull shades down to keep heat out.

We tried to get to Bangkok with Biman Bangladesh starting from Paris Orly. We should have left from Paris on Sunday but the flight to Dhaka was cancelled. No announcement no information nothing. We managed to find a Biman representative who told us the flight would leave Monday morning. We could stay at a hotel close to the airport terminal paid by Biman. We (and some more people that slept on the airport floor because they did not find the well hidden Biman representative) left on Monday but not straight to Dhaka. First to Rome to pick up some other passengers that got stuck there. Finally we took off to Dhaka and landed there in the middle of the night. Tickets and passports were taken and we could stay in a dirty hotel until the morning because the flight to Bangkok was leaving on Monday morning. The bus to the airport never picked us up. No flights to Bangkok on Monday ! You will fly tomorrow morning we were told with a great smile. Finally we arrived in Bangkok Tuesday instead of Sunday.

Before takeoff the normal checks on passengers' safety belt was not carried out. There was a door latch that was unserviceable in the pantry. Before takeoff the cabin crew placed boxes in front of this door in the attempt to prevent it from flipping open. The exterior of the airplane was very dirty. The interior décor of the cabin is poor. The seat covers which have floral designs are old and tattered. A making tape was found pasted on one of the in-flight screen monitor. This monitor was suspected to have cracked at its edge. There was also a foul smell of lavatory in the cabin throughout the flight. Despite sound system being built in the seats earphones were never distributed to the passengers. No movie were screened during the flight. Other that the in- flight magazine ‘Digonto’ no other reading materials were available in the cabin. Orange juice was served before the flight. After airborne dinner which consists of only one meat puff and two springs rolls were served immediately. This meal was accompanied by hot beverage and plain water. The female cabin crew wears traditional ‘sari’ that gives the passenger an exotic South Asian feel. Only basic and essential service like food distribution was rendered to the passengers and nothing more. The cabin crew never smiled throughout. The standard of Biman cannot be comparable on the world stage -services are tolerable for very short haul flights but not suited for passengers intending to travel international beyond 5 hours of flight.,Negative,Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
DAC-CGP Business Class. Flight delayed by two hours. The smell of aircraft fuel lingered onboard throughout the flight. The business class with its infamous floral seat covers in tatters. The seat configuration 2-3-2 on an airbus A310. Seat pitch poor (tighter than any other J class I have flown - pitch similar to WT+ on BA). Inflight service is minimal; pax offered water sweets pan masala and Biman's trademark 'Mango Bar' (which is quite good). Overall an ok flight - nothing to write home about. Biman should consider revamping their aircrafts - they are horrible. I don't believe Biman will be purchasing a new fleet of B777s and A330/340's anytime soon so better not keep hopes high. A poor airline Biman should get its act together as quickly as possible.,Mixed,Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
London-Dhaka-Sylhet. We were a group of 17 and booked 4 months in advance. After check-in we were hurried to board the plane and was one of the last to board. Upon entering the plane I was disappointed with the interior flowery seat covers and it looked like something from the seventies. This was the Airbus A300 the National Express coaches in England look a lot smarter! There was a lot of confusion with seating and my family was split up they wanted my 4yr old daughter and my 3yr old son to sit some distance away from us the crew constantly saying let us take off then you can swap seats with anyone. In the end a compromise was found with another family. The flight was ok and surprisingly on time. Entertainment was nothing at all food not bad all I can say is they should improve the look of the planes interiors and modernise things or they are going to lose a lot of business to other carriers. The only reason a lot of people use Biman is because of convenience of landing in Sylhet airport (Biman does not allow any other international flight to land in Sylhet yet 90% of Biman passengers are Sylhetis),Mixed,Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines
Delhi-Dhaka. Forced to take Biman as no other flights. Paid top fare as no discounts - in fact same fare as London-Delhi! Crew were awful. They ignored requests for blankets for the infant ordered passengers around and were very unhelpful with the pram. The screen did not work (on both ways) and so could not see any of the security demonstrations but it did not bother them. They made us sweat in the plane for absolutely ages before we had any aircon. The food was very poor quality and the drinks choice was lemonade cola or water - that's it! Filthy plane with ripped fittings. The crew did not check seat belts or close any trays and were no help at all with the infant belt. There seem to be many ranks of crew who ordered the lower ranks around! Many seats are taken up by free passengers who work for the airline or government.

I recently flew Biman Bangladesh Airlines from Bombay to Dhaka on J Class. The flight in to Mumbai from Dubai was over 2 hours late. Biman did not bother informing the passengers and repeated phone calls to Biman's Mumbai airport office went unanswered. Check-in was a nightmare without any dedicated counter for J class passengers. Once on board the cabin was extremely dirty and the toilet in the front of the plane was simply filthy. The food was sub-par for J class. Most of the passengers in the J Class cabin seemed to be Biman staff. No apologies for the delay either.

We are professional people with jobs to come back to not idle people who can stay for a few extra days/weeks!

I have flown Biman on the London-Dubai route many times. My belief is that service provided by Biman 20 or even 10 years ago was far superior to the service currently on offer. The reasons for this is that the DC-10s in use were younger at that time - cleaner and smoother. The main problems with Biman are that it has failed to modernise it's old fleet (root of all delays) failed to introduce modern in-flight entertainment (seatback videos) failed to address unprofessional hostesses failed to deal with it's corrupt booking officials and above all failed to appreciate the loyal customers which have kept it flying.

"Cox's Bazar to Dhaka with US-Bangla Airlines. The check-in process was smooth. The plane arrived exactly on time. But had to refuel for 15mins. We were on a full family trip.

I don't know about others, but my experience was satisfactory.",Positive,"""my experience was satisfactory""",US_Bangla_Airlines
" Sylhet to Dhaka. Absolutely awful probably the worst airline, very rude, very unprofessional, don’t know how they can be so rude towards customers. I was at Sylhet  at 11am and had a domestic flight at 2:05pm, we had to wait 5 hours. We ended up missing our international flight and they put us in a very nasty hotel.",Negative,"""very rude, very unprofessional""",US_Bangla_Airlines
Dhaka to Jessore. It was really a bad experience when the plane started to take off and after a while there was problem with the flight’s fan or whatever there were some technical issues and then they stopped on emergency basis and later on after a while they started with the same plane though they told us to shift in a new one. After going a little further the plane again stopped at their runway due to the same problem. Then they shifted us to a new plane. The matter here is their unprofessionalism which is really disgraceful. I really would never like to fly with them again.,Negative,"""unprofessionalism is really disgraceful""",US_Bangla_Airlines
" Dhaka to Jessore. I find the name of this private airline in Bangladesh a bit funny. Other than that no complaints. Arrived at the domestic terminal in Dhaka 7 minutes before the scheduled morning departure due to being severely delayed due to road traffic. The check-in desk completed all formalities, rushed us through security, had a limo ready for us to escort me and my partner to the aircraft at the remote stand. The flight left after our boarding and exactly on time. I have never experienced this kind of dedication and professionalism with an airline. The flight to Jessore lasted 25 minutes onboard a clean and attractive Dash-8 Q400 and we were served a sandwich, cake and a water bottle by friendly and smiley flight attendants. The return flight to Dhaka a couple of days later was just as good but we made sure we arrived promptly for check-in this time. We were served a mini burger, cake and water bottle.",Positive,"""friendly and smiley flight attendants""",US_Bangla_Airlines
" Singapore to Dhaka. Flew with Regent Airways for the first time today. Is it the airline policy not to provide blankets to passengers? I thought it was a given in any airline.The staff mentioned to a male passenger it will be hot later on the plane so no need for blanket. What kind of explanation is that? Paying for ticket is also paying for the service and goods within the airline for that period of travel for usage. Also, the staff serving are not happy and don't smile.  They should improve their service attitude.",Negative,"""should improve their service attitude""",Regent_Airways
Terrible experience with Regent Air. I booked a round trip ticket from Singapore to Dhaka. The departing flight was delayed for 4 hours without any prior notice. The return flight was canceled without minimal effort to make an alternative arrangement. The staff are rude and abusive in attitude.

" Kolkata to Chattogram. Problem occurred at Boarding pass counter. Limit of my bags weight 35. It shows on boarding counter scale, but just 30 minutes ago I Traveled from Delhi to Kolkata by Air India. Ok though I agree with this. I have a hand bag of 05 kg. If the counter lady have gave me the opportunity for transferring some of my accessories to my hand bag then problem solved. Moreover do 3kg very much overweight?

" My 11:45 am flight from Coxs Bazar to Dhaka got rescheduled twice at 2:30 pm. Then, I went to check with Regent boarding desk at 2:15 pm to know that the flight has completed boarding at Dhaka only. Which means the flight from CXB is not taking off before 3:30 or 4 pm. This made me look at Regent Airways customer reviews and holy shit the review page didn’t have a single good customer review! A strong indicator that Regent Airways Management doesn’t prioritize anything between their flight timing, customer service, and overall flying experience. Not taking another Regent flight again, and suggesting the same to my family and friends unless the service improves!",Mixed,"""Not taking another Regent flight""",Regent_Airways
Unprofessional mannerless attitude. We flew from Dhaka to Cox's Bazar at new years eve. Due to govt. Election flight was delayed 1.5 hours. But they didn’t mention that before. After sitting on the aircraft we came to know about that. We were stuck into the flight for all that time. The ground staffs behaviour was nice and professional.

Cox's Bazar to Dhaka. The inbound flight was delayed by more than 1 hour due to dense fog at Dhaka which delayed the aircraft to come. The check in & luggage handling was quick & they made us board the plane as soon as the incoming passengers got of. The cabin crew need to improve their communication skills as they distributed mass snacks to the entire row of passengers & let the passengers of that row distribute snacks among themselves. It may be boring doing the same work again & again, but, still, a cabin crew can easily provide a sandwich to a passenger sitting beside the window in a single aisle aircraft.  Good airlines do operate old aircraft, but, its the attitude of the cabin crew & on board product that make all the difference. I don't recommend Regent on international routes as there are so many other airlines operate out of Bangladesh with outstanding on board services like Qatar, Singapore etc.",Negative,"""don't recommend on international""",Regent_Airways
" Dhaka to Cox's Baza. Booked a discounted ticket more than a month ago. Didn't expect too much. Just on time departure & arrival. That's what I got. Boarding & luggage handling was smooth. Cabin crew wasn't exactly cordial, but professional enough. It was a 40min ride, but the captain was able to make it bumpy despite clear weather. Cheese sandwich & cake was good enough for a shorts haul flight like this, but as expected no IFE. Aircraft was manufactured in 2001, so common for local Bangladeshi carriers. But the seats were good pitch even for a Dutch national who flew alongside me & was well over 6'. Hope for a similar experience with Regent next time.",Positive,"""seats were good pitch""",Regent_Airways
"As soon as I boarded the plane, it was hot. Air conditioner was not on. It got hotter, and hotter, and hotter inside the plane while all others after me boarded. That process took roughly about 40 minutes for everybody to board. Despite many people trying to cool themselves by fanning newspapers or whatever that were in their hands and requests to the crew to switch on the air conditioner, it was still not switched on. When, finally, the plane started moving, I thought the ac would now be switched on - bot no - they still would not switch it on. The plane spent 20 minutes taxiing on the tarmac before taking off. The air conditioners finally came on about 7 minutes into the flight, for a flight that only lasts 30 minutes. The same thing happened on the return, with no air conditioner on until well into the flight. This is utterly disgusting on the part of Regent Airways. I have flown on this airline before as well, and the same thing happened on those occasions as well. If Regent Airways are reading this, please increase your fares to cover the cost of fuel for keeping the ac on right from the time of boarding to keep passengers comfortable. This is obviously a cost cutting exercise in fuel costs - but this is really disgusting. I am pretty sure all those waving their newspapers and anything else to keep themselves cool would much prefer to pay a few more Taka extra for the ac to be kept on than the terrible experience they get whilst on board your flights.",Negative,"""It got hotter, and hotter""",Regent_Airways

" Dhaka to Kolkata. We were kept waiting for 15 mins due to their software problems, even in the business class queue. At last, they checked us in under special service from another counter. The flight was delayed by 2.5hrs due to heavy fog that day. But for the business class ticket, we were given a good lounge with premium food and wi-fi. So wasn't much frustrated. We were chauffeured to our aircraft in a 2006 Toyota Axio. But we were a little disappointed as despite for paying for business class, our seats were not good. The galley's wall was in front of us, so we were deprived of a lot of leg room. But suddenly, a passenger fell ill as the plane taxied to the runway for take-off. So the plane had to go back to its initial position, drop off the sick passenger in an ambulance and then returned to the runway, resulting in another 40 min delay. At last, the plane took off. The food quality (snacks), was average. Was served a hot dog, shwarma, and cake. But the seat itself was comfortable beside Window. There was no infotainment system at all, let alone wi-fi. So was a bit disappointed. Landed at Kolkata after a short 30 min flight.",Mixed,"""our seats were not good""",Regent_Airways
Singapore to Dhaka. This was my first trip in Regent Airways. Very disappointing as the seats were uncomfortable with no digital entertainment or even any magazines other then newspapers. 4 hours journey felt like a never ending one. Worse was when they gave us an meal option to choose between 2 dishes A and B. Me and my wife both chose the same type A. The steward said they ran short of the same type.

We have been inside the terrible plane with horrible experience more than 30 minutes. They were unable to open the door for half an hour.

" Chittagong to Dhaka with Regent Airways. A moderately good airline that is quickly going downhill. I fly the Regent domestic route (Chittagong to Dhaka) 5 to 10 times a year for business and international routes (Dhaka - Bangkok and Dhaka - Kuala Lumpur) typically three times a year. Regent used to be my go-to option to avoid the national joke that is Biman Airlines, but over the past year, Regent's reliability with domestic flights has gone significantly downhill, with consistently late flights and a frequently chaotic check-in process to get a boarding pass. Regent now offers consistent delays of 30 - 90 minutes for a routine daily domestic flight and staff who open the ticketing counter 20 minutes before the flight's takeoff time and then rush passengers along as if it's their fault. Flight delays because of weather or other unavoidable circumstances are understandable, but when it's due to poor planning or airline staff just showing up late, it's absurd. I've emailed Regent directly using their online customer service form and, of course, haven't received any response.",Negative,"""quickly going downhill""",Regent_Airways

Overall value for money.",Mixed,"""overall value for money""",Regent_Airways
I have flown with Regent a couple of times between Dhaka and Chittagong and Cox's Bazar and in general have found them to be OK although the air conditioning on their Dash 8 aircraft frequently doesn't work. However more recently I have twice flown with Regent on their new 737-400 aircraft fro Dhaka to Bangkok. However when they say new this actually means new for them as both aircraft are leased from other airlines and are actually starting to show signs of age. Only one of them has an onboard entertainment system which didn't work when I was on board and the other (seemingly older) aircraft actually still has ash trays in the arm rests which have been taped up to stop people from using them but on a lot of the seats the ash trays have been removed leaving a rather sharp and dangerous metal edge on the end of the arm rest. On my last trip from BK back to Dhaka the Pilot went AWOL and so were almost 2 hours late leaving BK. The meals on board are very typically Bangladesh and not good and of course you cannot get an alcoholic drink on board. The tea and coffee is also pretty bad. The FA's are for the most part friendly enough but efficiency is not their highpoint. However despite their shortcomings their prices are very good.,Mixed,Regent Airways customer review,Regent_Airways

"I traveled from London to Bangladesh. Biman needs to have more direct flights from Sylhet to London because I had to go to Bangladesh and stay at a disgusting hotel. I flew from Bangladesh to London in 11 hours. The new Biman 787-9 was really good. The seats were very comfortable and the windows were tinted. Since it was a morning flight and everyone was awake, there was no flight entertainment since the IFE screen was not set. The flight live map will satisfy me but not the kids.

When I asked for something basic like a cup of water, the staff seemed overwhelmed but friendly. They didn't offer my toddler any friendly encouragement or the usual game to keep him occupied, neither did I see any other cistern on the flight get any friendly attention from the staff.

"We took off on time. Biman's new plane had business class on it. The service was good. The seats are comfortable. The new aircraft was dirty and broke. Things degrade quickly here.

Biman is almost always late, aircraft can't be guaranteed, and this brand new craft is a mess. 6 out of 10 is based on cheap price.",Mixed,,

"Biman is a very basic and simple airline but you get an acceptable level of service as long as you don't expect too much. We can't expect anymore. You should expect more from the experience. The seats are comfortable for a long flight. Biman planes are better at time-keeping and schedules are more reliable because of this. Biman flight hosts and hostesses disappear after serving food and never return. The flight crew are usually not in a good mood, so be careful how you interact with them. In these days of political correctness and hurt feelings any raised voices or harsh words will result in massive problems for you. Don't shout. Stay calm. A safe and hassle-free flight to Sylhet is what you want. There is only one way to get to Siberia from the UK. We have no other choice. Don't let the flight crew's sadness affect your trip. They should be left to wallow in their depression. I have sympathy with the flight crew as they can be some of the most uncouth and uncivilised people you will ever come across, but just say 'Thank you' and smile at the appropriate times. Sylhetis are some of the most engaging and fascinating people to spend 9 hours on a plane with. Don't use the loos if you can. The loos are not usable after a couple of hours. Your real problems will begin as soon as you land in Sylhet, so use the time to watch a movie, get some sleep and save your energy. Biman personal in Sylhet and Dhaka airports are crooks. In Bangladesh, criminals who are in jail are given uniforms and jobs at the airports. Don't trust any of the bandits. If you go away from the banditry of the airport, you will discover that Sylhet and Bangladesh are the most beautiful places you can visit. There is a juxtaposition of modernity and innovation with old and classical traditions. You will be welcomed with open arms by the local people who will offer help and assistance. The people in Biman Bangladesh Airlines and the airports do not represent the best of Bangladesh, so I would recommend Biman Bangladesh Airlines. There is nothing else to do at the time of writing. 9 hours after you get on the plane, you're in Sylhet. I am very grateful for that.",Mixed,,
"Biman Bangladesh Airlines is good for domestic routes, but never traveled out of Bangladesh, so I can't tell you about it. The price is reasonable because the airlines are owned by the government. It has timing issues.",Mixed,,

"It is business class, but not as you know it. If you are used to other major carriers. It is the only direct flight from LHR to DAC, with a 1 hour stop in sylet, and for $1K and change, it is hard to complain. The seats on the aircraft are almost fully flat for sleeping. The food is cheap compared to what you would expect from business class. Bollywood films are much more modern and better quality than the western films that are provided in the 10inch screen in the seat in front. If you own a set of headphones, use it with your own set of headphones, because they crackle lots. It's rarely possible to charge up with theusb in the seat. The only complaint I have is that the staff seem to think that they are doing you a favor by allowing you onto their plane. If you're a frequent visitor of Bangladesh, I don't pay much attention, but if you're on your first trip with Biman, they are very friendly and helpful, just try to look past the time it takes for them to do anything. I travel Biman on average three times a year, and I always recommend the national carrier of Bangladesh for both work and tourist visits. The flight from London to Dhaka will be delayed by around 2 hours. It is never on time. When you leave for the UK, security at Dhaka is very intensive, so you should prepare for a long Security queue on the way back.",Mixed,,
"Biman was an emotional choice when he returned from Umrah. It was hard to accept service. After boarding, the cabin was too hot to start the AC without starting the engine. It was necessary to sustain for some time. Didn't like the food. The flight was delayed by an hour. Biman lags a good deal in terms of service compared to other careers. Hope that Biman will return to its former glory.",Mixed,,

"Biman has many criticisms about the service, mainly for lack of on time departures, but the flight I took to KL from Dhaka was fine. The plane was clean and new. The food was good, but the portion was less. The lack of planes in the fleet causes the flights to be delayed. Many flights are delayed due to bad weather or mechanical issues. I would fly Biman again if the fare is low and the schedule is convenient.",Mixed,,
There are a lot of complaints about this airline. I've seen both the best and worst of flights. Worst thing would be flight delays and not so helpful staffs and best thing would be friendly helpful staffs with nice experiences. It's not certain what kind of service you're going to get. Things are getting better in my experience.,Mixed,,
"Bangladesh Biman are trying to make improvements if they are to attract a more diverse passenger group and shake off their reputation for poor customer service. The attitude and performance of the cabin crew were good, even though my flight out from LHR left 30 minutes late. There was no apology or clear announcements on the return journey, with disinterested cabin staff and an unattractive menu. They can't arrange priority boarding for business class passengers. Biman's main problem is that they can't provide consistency or continuity in standards and you never know what quality and standard of journey it will prove to be. If they are ever to deliver a comparable brand and service to most other flying in/out of Dhaka, they must have a more corporate strategy. It has a good value for money on a business/executive class ticket.",Mixed,,
The flight service was excellent and the seat was comfortable. The economy passengers have to queue with the priority boarding passengers. There is no fast track pass for immigration.,Mixed,,

"Biman is the only flight that flies from London to Bangladesh. It takes between 10 and 12 hours to get to Dhaka. I love the take-off and landing of Biman, it is so smooth. All the Boeings are great but once due to some issues they have rented Turkish airlines and I think the size was a bit smaller than our Boeings, where at the end hours I had breathing issues. I have never called the flight attendants for any issues, but they were fine with their regular duties, and the main problems are with ourselves. People are smoking in the toilets and the attendants are running after them. During the time of landing, passengers are not listening, they are not seating, and they are taking out their cabin luggages, which can cause serious accidents. They fight over who can get off first, is it a local bus or something? When all these passengers are in a hurry, I always keep seated and get off. Our passengers ask for food, block the alleys, and make the toilets dirty. The people who work for Biman have a problem. I was in Bangladesh and had to change my flight date because of a fine, but the officers said there was nothing left. They asked for a bribe and offered seats. I have to go back to London. The flight was not full and they lied about the seats. We are two and I like to book 3 seats in a row. You can keep some movies in your gadgets if the TV in the back seat doesn't work. It is not great but it is not bad.",Mixed,,
"Biman takes a half hour trip from KOL to the other side of the country. The last time I was on this route with Biman, the flight was suddenly delayed. I was supposed to reach Dhaka at 9 pm. It became a safety issue for a solo traveler. Thankfully, I was able to get a cab to leave the airport after midnight. Damn! Standard service from an International airlines is expected in the near future.",Mixed,,
This is the only direct flight from Bangladesh to London. Biman flew us from London to Dhaka with my wife. The overall service was good.,Mixed,,
"The CCU-RGN route has a plane change at Dhaka. This is the most economical and efficient route that you can take to reachMyanmar from India. There were delays in the Kolkata-Dhaka and the Yangon-Dhaka segments. Passengers don't get stranded if the connecting flights are delayed. This deliberate delay was good for us. We paid about 14500 for each round ticket. Not cheap (compared to European no frills airlines for the distance), but considerably cheaper than competition like Air India. Food is provided in such flights.",Mixed,,
I didn't get that airbus because it was used for Hajj flight. The first row of economy seats gave us more space than other seats. The seats are small and not comfortable.,Mixed,,
"The flight was delayed for a while. Biman is still late at times but it has recently recovered from its reputation of being always late. Being the national carrier, I expect better service in terms of ground and luggage handling. I think in-flight attendants could be a little more careful with passenger demands.",Mixed,,
Older planes have more space than newer ones. The newer planes have nicer interiors but are small. The food and service are good.,Mixed,,
An old aircraft. There is a shabby interior. A less expensive carrier will allow you to forget other short comings.,Mixed,,
"The aircraft was clean and the bites on board were ok, but the major issue was the mosquitos inside the aircraft. The boarding process and transit boarding was messy, but value for money, considering the fact that other airlines for these sectors were expensive.",Mixed,,
An airline is flying with an old type aircraft. I was happy that they agreed to allow me an extra 8 kilograms of luggage.,Mixed,,
"I had to run to catch my return flight because the plane interior was old and not well maintained, there was no leg room, and the flight was delayed for 3 hours or more. I was surprised that the food tasted good. The crews on this flight were very accommodating, helpful and super nice, and they were always smiling and asking you if you need something. The flight attendants are very nice and treat all passengers the same.",Mixed,,
Biman is sad. I flew several times in a plane. The plane was at least 30 years old. There is orange cloth on the seats. The price was correct.,Mixed,,
Biman operates a Boeing plane in this route. Economy class seats were comfortable. The journey was bumpy but the air craft was ok. The flight crews were good but not for everyone. The food was average. I was told that they were not carrying any duty free items.,Mixed,,
"I was impressed with the standard of the aircraft. The cabin crews were not good. If they improve the behavior of the cabin crews, they will be even better.",Mixed,,
"Inflight service is good. Customer service is good. The seats are comfortable. If the flight is not domestic, you can go to London and New York nonstop.",Mixed,,
The cabin crew needs to be more trained.,Mixed,,
"The flight was bumpy because of the weather, but the problem was the leg room, my seat number was 19",Mixed,,
"I bought this airline ticket because it was cheaper than other airlines. The flights were delayed. At both flights, the temperature was high, but it became cooler after the first flight.",Mixed,,
There are operated aircraft on the domestic routes. The seating was comfortable and it was not noisy. Passengers on this flight get a hot sandwich. It's not bad!,Mixed,,
"I am a frequent traveler and had my first experience with US Bangla. The reason for choosing US bangla is their price. They try to maintain the interior of the aircraft. The Training of the Pilot, I have never felt the landing from Dhaka to CAN on average. The authority should take care of those issues.",Mixed,,
The check in station is chaotic and awful. It wasn't perfect. The first wheel touched turmac and them both. It was very rare. I don't know why but it was frightening.,Mixed,,
"The sound of the engine or AC was frightening at times, but the service was good. Their food was good.",Mixed,,
"After enjoying the holiday, Flown from Chittagong to Dhaka. It was a pleasant journey, except for a bottle of water and no onboard meals. An unusual noise in the first 15-20 minutes was annoying. US-Bangla needs to pay more attention to passengers. Good luck.",Mixed,,
The flight experience is not good. The bit of noise is not expected. The cabin is not very clean. Good food. The cabin crews were exhausted. They will involve them in 3 flights in a row. The seat was comfortable.,Mixed,,
"My mother and I flew to Kolkata for treatment. They took care of my mom very well and provided a wheel chair. We are happy. When we arrived in Kolkata, the wheel chair attendant asked for a lot of money, but the US- Bangla Counter officer advised us not to carry anything. We heard it for the first time. The travel was good but the flight was late.",Mixed,,
"I had to go to Chittagong in April of 2016 for an emergency. I got a ticket at the airport. I was satisfied with the boarding and ticketing. It was ok to take off. The staffs were good and the meal was good, but the landing was bad. We were afraid. Nothing happened after the Bless of Almighty Allah Subhanutaala.",Mixed,,
They were new to the international routes. Their staffs are not well trained to control their passengers. The food was not good. The journey was ok if I considered it a budget airline.,Mixed,,
"Within a week after a tragic incident with this airline, flyingusb was just a wee bit concerning but logic is the opposite. After an incident like this, everything will be checked and compliant. The cabin service was ok and the food was average. The luggage arrived at the airport in less than 40 minutes. I don't think the airline is to blame.",Mixed,,
The plane was a Dash 8. There was plenty of room between seats and the food was good for a westerner who doesn't like spicy food from the Banglas.,Mixed,,
"I use this airline a lot when I travel to Bangladesh and back. The airlines and its cabin crew are well behaved, but the ground crew still needs to improve their handling of people. You have to serve yourself because the aircraft does not have an entertainment system.",Mixed,,
"I took a flight recently. They need to improve on their cabin crew members. While I was coming back, I requested a window seat at the check in counter, but when I boarded, I found my seat occupied by someone else. The overall experience was average but the price they are offering is very competitive.",Mixed,,
"I traveled with them twice. It took less than 30 minutes. After the take off, they served some refreshment. It was. The flight was delayed more than two hours. It was expected since it was on the day of ""Akheri Munajat"" of Biswa Ijtema.",Mixed,,
"When you wake up in the morning with a cup of coffee, you'll see a text saying your flight will leave at 6:30pm instead of 3.30pm. I decided to check if there was an earlier flight at the airport. We got the 6pm one. 15 minutes after departure time, the boarding happened.",Mixed,,
"I traveled many times and found the same problem again and again. After several flying experiences, it seems the company really need to work on air conditioning of their aircraft if they don't want to loose passengers in this competitive market.",Mixed,,
It's only through regent when we fly to Chittagong. We flew with an infant. Overall experience was good. Extra care is usually provided by other airlines when travelling with an infant. I had to remind them to provide a seat belt for my baby. It would have been unsafe if I hadn't had prior flying experience with an infant.,Mixed,,
The service is good. The flights are on time and the crews are professional. The aircraft is well mentained and the flights are ok. I don't think the ac is a problem because it feels hot inside.,Mixed,,
We went to Kathmandu by Regent Airways. Regent is the cheapest airlines company in Bangladesh for both domestic and international flights. They are cheap and so we didn't expect much. The meal is ok.,Mixed,,
It was a good flight. Nothing special to mention. The food portion size should increase as it did not clash with my office hours. A tip for credit card holders is to have a good meal.,Mixed,,
"The plane was large, but I felt crowded inside. Their sits are not comfortable. Overall, it was average.",Mixed,,
Other airlines provide shuttle service from the airport to the city.,Mixed,,
"A snack box and soft drink are included in the 30 minute flight. Within 10 minutes of landing, baggage was on the belt. The check-in and boarding service at the gate was not good.",Mixed,,
"If you're looking for an airline with strong domestic connections, this is a good choice. All the other national carriers fly on these routes. They just transport you and there is no inflight entertainment. The quality of refreshment was poor. It has a poor on time performance. If you're flying within Bangladesh, look to travel by Novo Air. I would like to say that they're expanding. With the expansion of their fleet, I hope they expand their management and bring in more professionalism.",Mixed,,
"They used to be a benchmark. Leg space is too crowded for a budget airline. The seats are not very comfortable and need to be changed. The food is good, the service is good, and the attitude of the crew is average. The flight from Dhaka to BKK was tiring since there was a stop in another city. Next time, would choose direct flight at the same price.",Mixed,,
"I flew from Kolkata to Bangladesh with my family. The flight was on time and the in-cabin service was good. An airline can't be judged solely by flying once for a short hop. I didn't use the toilet in that time. Unless someone complains about the airline, I'll fly again.",Mixed,,
Regent Airways Bangladesh started operation in the last 5 years and now has several international flights and domestic flights. The flight from DAC to CUU was on time. The new plane was clean. The flight left on time. The landing at CCU was not comfortable and the aircraft came to a stop a short distance away.,Mixed,,
Noting only their timing. They maintain their timing. Average standards are the rest of the things.,Mixed,,
"My flight was at 8pm for the Dhaka - Chittagong route. There were 2 flights at the same time. Our scheduled flight has been changed due to the fact that only one flight will be there. After 12 hours, they told us that the flight will take off at 9pm and pick up some passengers from Chittagong. The bigger plane has about 125 seats. Our scheduled plane was a small domestic plane. A small plane (40-50 seat) was used for Cox's bazar to dhaka flight. Food tasted bad.Flight attendants' service was good. It is okay that there is no flight entertainment.",Mixed,,
It's really cheap. The inner interior is average. The food they provided was not special. They cancel flight almost frequently without any notice or information. They are giving opportunities to fly with a reasonable cost from Bangladesh.,Mixed,,
There is room for improvement for a good value. The food did not suit me. I had to ask for the newspaper three times. The seats are very comfortable.,Mixed,,
"My wife and I traveled to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Our journey begins at night. The internal environment was average. The food was good and the staffs were helpful. They don't have anything to do. The journey was average. They are cheap, but not great.",Mixed,,
The flight departed on time but they didn't use the boarding bridge so we had to walk in the hot and humid day.,Mixed,,
"The regent air craft is small but comfortable. Every thing that comes to Bangladesh is not perfect. One passenger said his AC wasn't working, another said his handle was broken. Over all is good.",Mixed,,
"The cabin service is good, but leg space is not enough.",Mixed,,
The flight was delayed due to lack of professionalism by the ground crew. The landing was good. They took too long for luggage handing. It should be improved.,Mixed,,
The flight from Dhaka to kolkata was delayed. The flight took off at 19:30. We were 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 800-273-3217 Food can be eaten for a short flight. They have 2 sandwiches and a slice of cake. On the way back flight there was no delay and it was much cooler than our departure flight. The air craft looks old and makes a lot of noise.,Mixed,,
The airline was cost efficient and friendly. The staff of group service were friendly. There is no inflight entertainment on this airline.,Mixed,,
This is my last trip to London. Biman has improved their service. My family and I are very pleased with the services they provide. The employees are friendly. The boarding gate environment is very nice and the seats are very comfortable. The food was great. There were no complaints about Biman.,Mixed,,
"Biman Bangladesh Airlines flew me to Bangkok. Good food, good seating and good ground services. The staff is just OK. The ground staff should be more professional. The price of my last travel ticket was high.",Mixed,,
"The city of Manchester went to Sylhet. It was one of the worst experiences for my parents. Both were aged 80 plus. It all started at the airport. The lady at the desk had a sour face, not giving eye contact or listening. There were doctors letters, we had already talked to the airline, I specifically described their medical needs, and they had bracelets to show their claims. She said everything was okay. The idea was to provide them with an aisle seat so they wouldn't have accidents on the plane that would affect other passengers. The flight was delayed and my parents were made to sit in the middle of cramped conditions in knee to knee seats. They tried to show the cabin crew the letters, but they were completely ignored. When it's been arranged, there's others to consider as well. The cabin crews are expected to follow the instructions. Appalling behavior from Biman Bangladesh Airlines.",Mixed,,
"In August of 2019. Good food, good seating and good ground services. The staffs are all ok. The ground staff should be more professional. The price of my last travel ticket was high.",Mixed,,
To Dhaka. There was a long line at the airport. The staff on the plane were the only ones who didn't like seat comfort. The staff could be more professional. They don't respond to calls in flight. The cabin crew can be more welcoming.,Mixed,,
"To Rajshahi. It was a nice meal. The crew was good. The boarding was quick. The flight was full. The crew provided food before the engine started. The crew needs to be more careful about showing safety instructions. Biman did not have a good lavatory for short haul flights. It had no tissue, but it was clean. I'm happy to use Biman again.",Mixed,,
"Singapore to London via Bangladesh. Absolutely terrible. The flight was delayed for over four hours. I missed my connecting flight because of that. The service and food is okay, but the fact that the flight couldn't leave on time is amazing.",Mixed,,
"Biman charges half of what renowned carriers charge for Business Class fares between London and Bangladesh. Keeping that in mind and the fact that there is no change of aircraft required for this trip by Biman, you get a decent offering. I like the B777-300ER aircraft. Business Class cabin has 35 angle flat seats. There are large PTVs in English and Hindi. A bilingual flight tracker is provided. The package included games for children and some audio with Indian Classical Music. There are headphones, blankets and pillows. The kit only had eye shades and socks. There are a lot of food choices. The second service was the same as the first. The meal service presentation was terrible. FAs need to arrange the meal tray before bringing it to the passengers, and remove all plastic and foil wraps from serving dishes. Biman needed to excel in soft drinks. Fruit juices were of poor quality. I expect bigger glasses without having to ask. Business Class has freshly squeezed orange. Black tea was of poor quality. Business Class passengers should not be given coke and cans by FA. The drinks should be brought from the galley. Two ladies and two gentlemen were FAs. The men were loitering around the galley while the ladies did all the work. The female FAs struggled to perform their duties and then went above and beyond with any personal touches like asking about extra drinks or food. Personal touches were missing. The ladies wore sari uniforms. The men had poor grooming. Fresh South Asian inspired uniforms and training are needed for male FAs. Lounge access was provided at the beginning of both trips. There is a hot towel and newspaper when you take seats. Everyone is given a drink to welcome them. The airline caters to people in Bangladesh. If more international travellers are to be attracted, beverage service needs to be improved.",Mixed,,
"Kathmandu to Bangladesh. It was the best decision we had ever made. It took some time but bags with the Biz Class tag were given access to the lounge at the airport. There is food and drinks, but no views of the airport. Went through security and it was a mob scene. It was hot and crowded because there were so many flights leaving at the same time. Boarded by bus to the plane and was welcomed by the flight attendants. One of the best flights ever. Row 1 A/B has a lot of leg-room. FA's apologized, but we didn't mind. The service from boarding to deplaning was second to none. The only people in Business were us. Take off gave us amazing views of Kathmandu and the route took us along the Himalays. Everest! The meal was delicious and the drinks were plentiful. The FA kept us entertained on the flight when they talked to us about what to see in Dhaka. After we got our visa, bags came out quickly. I would like to fly them long-haul and see how they fare in the class.",Mixed,,
"London to Toronto. Biman Bangladesh was 2 hours late and I along with 9 other people missed the connecting Air Canada flight from London. The next flight is 17 hours away, and since you can't stay inside the airport, you have to find your own lodging. When I and the other passengers started talking about our rights as passengers, they booked the flight and agreed to provide accommodations. The Biman agents were rude. ""Biman is always late, I don't understand why other airlines give us as connecting flight,"" they said. Biman doesn't post their delayed time online. I don't understand why Biman's schedule needs to be adjusted if he's always late. The cleaning crew stayed in Sylhet for an hour while the passengers were on the plane. Put the blankets in a garbage bag and put it in the bathroom. The inflight entertainment was terrible. I prefer to sleep anyways, so that's not a deal breaker for me. You can always depend on Biman to be late, be treated as if they are doing you a favour, and never again with Biman.",Mixed,,
"The flight from Bangladesh to Thailand was average. I like travelling by Biman but maybe that's because I haven't experienced delays as much. I would not pay to be on Biman's Business Class. This flight was bought for me so I did not care too much, but for those of you who are considering paying for Business Class, please consider the following points: 1) You will not enjoy the in-flight entertainment system that they have. I couldn't find a better song to play on the flight. The interior of the cabin will make you feel like you are in the 70s. The china used for the flight feels very old and not in a classy vintage way. The food was average. The prawn salad was bland. The chef did not do a good job. The menu could have been better. On my way back from Thailand, the food in economy class tasted better. The hot towels were not moist. They just handed out warm towels. Being a clear day, I was able to look down and enjoy the sight below. I would have been bored. The seats were not bad and it was spacious. The staff provided a nice service. They served an excellent dessert.",Mixed,,
"It has been almost ten years since Biman Bangladesh Airlines last flew with them. There were a lot of overweight travellers at the check in. Biman use Gulf Air at the airport. It's worth paying a surcharge for some peace. There were good seats and a clean interior on the new plane. Inflight entertainment is adequate, but not great. The meals were adequate but not as good as the airlines. Biman seems to have made some improvements, but there are still some negatives. The cabin crew seem disengaged as if they don't like their jobs, they need to smile more and be friendly. There is a poor selection of soft drinks. They don't serve drinks on flights or before take off. You have to ask for blankets because they don't provide hot towels.",Mixed,,
Two flights from Singapore to Bangladesh. The flights were on time. The B737 was used to serve Singapore. The aircraft are really old. It was a long way from Dhaka to Chittagong. The cabin crews were nice. It was a good decision to fly Tiger Air or Biman. Let's see what the return flight has in store for me.,Mixed,,
"Biman's A310 was used to travel from DAC to KTM. The flight was delayed for over five hours. The flight was almost empty. The cabin crews behaved well. The food was cold but tasty. There wasn't an IFE system and magazines weren't provided. The return flight was very good. There was no delay. Food was good, but not as good as it could have been. I would love to fly Biman again.",Mixed,,
There is a route that leads to the DAC-LHR-DAC route. The value for money was reasonable. Inflight entertainment was not very good. The staff was attentive to the customers. The food was good. The flights were on time. Will fly with the airline again if their quality improves.,Mixed,,
"Kuala Lumpur - Kathmandu. The flights were on time. The flights that were old were KUK - Dhaka. I can't complain as a 2 star airline. There were not many choices of food in the portion size that was good. The cabin crews were not paying attention to their passengers. If I can get a cheaper price, I will fly with them again.",Mixed,,
LHR-ZYL. ZYL-DAC-LHR. Biman had 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 was 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 888-282-0465 The outbound flight left 10 minutes early. Biman's 3rd new Boeing 777 300ER was only a month old and was completely fresh inside. The seats were a bit dreary but comfortable. Some of the staff need to smile more because they were nice and friendly. The food was good. There was a delay of 2 hours on the inbound flight from ZYL to DAC. The plane was in good shape. The Bimans 2nd Boeing (Arun Alo) was clean until a few hours in to the flight when the toilets became a mess. I would fly with Biman again when I travel to Bangladesh as it only takes 9.5 hours rather than 15 hours if I had used another airline.,Mixed,,
"In October there was a flight from Bangladesh to London with a new Boeing 777 on business class. They need to look after their Business class passengers a bit more. Plane was new and entertainment was good. I found Biman Business class to be even better than the Qatar Economy food. When the announcement was made for economy class not to do this and that it was broadcast throughout the plane, I hated it. I will fly again.",Mixed,,
"Due to no seats being available with Singapore Airlines, I had to fly from Singapore to Bangladesh with Biman in Business Class. The flight was delayed for almost 4 hours without explanation. The flight crew needs to learn to smile. The food was ok but not Business Class standards and they had a very limited selection of drinks and on-board entertainment, not everyone wants to watch Bollywood movies and the screens were too small. The aircraft was clean but starting to show it's age. Even though it was less than 5 hours, the toilets were a mess by the end of the flight. The price was the only good point. The Business Class ticket was half the price of the Economy ticket. Unless I have other options, I won't be flying Biman again.",Mixed,,
The airport is called Sylhet. Passengers failed to listen to instructions given by cabin crew as their departure was delayed. The female cabin crew needs to smile more. The new B777 is comfortable and has decent entertainment. The quality of the food could be improved. The joke about Sylhet airport is a different topic altogether. I am happy with the service and the price I paid.,Mixed,,
"Recently, London -Dhaka-Sylhet. When we arrived at LHR, it took over two of us to check in. We were not told the reason for the delay or how long we would have to wait. Our flight was delayed for 12 hours and there were two boys running around in the airport. We boarded the plane at midnight. The Biman cabin crew gave a poor service. When I asked them for anything, they were curt and less helpful. They didn't try to make us comfortable. The journey wasn't any better on the way back. The transit time before we boarded the plane for London would be shorter because we had prebooked to arrive by the last flight from Sylhet, but we were made to take the first flight to Dhaka when the tickets were reconfirmed. It took over two hours for us to be taken to a hotel after we arrived in Bangladesh. The staff at the airport did not pay attention to the needs of parents with young children. The officials made us wait obscene lengths of time before they even noticed us, and I had to stand in ceremony in front of them. It must have been one of the worst hotels in Bangladesh. The four of us were ushered into a dark and dirty room with no windows or natural day light. The bed was filthy and the furniture was shoddy. The service from the cabin crew was terrible. I stopped being appalled by anything because it is the norm with Biman Bangladesh airlines.",Mixed,,
"There is a promotion offer for business class BKK to LHR. The lounge was fair to good. Good snacks and alcoholic drinks. Considering the old aircraft and limited staff, the food is good. Beer and red wine were requested. The lounge is at the poor. The Economy Class area is worse than the dirty chairs area. There is only coffee and alcohol in the bar. The old DC10food poor and business class were invaded by air crew going on holiday. It's okay for Duty Free in Dubai. The LHR food and drinks are very good. Good value for money. To get the best connection times, choose your flight dates carefully. 11 new A330 aircraft have been ordered.",Mixed,,
"The worst airline I've ever flown is New Delhi to Dhaka. On a scale of 0-10 with 0 the worst and 10 the best Biman rates. The check-in experience was terrible. The process took over an hour because there was no order or organization. People were cutting in line in front of me. There wasn't enough staff and the staff didn't seem to know what they were doing. I checked two bags and paid the excess baggage fee. They don't accept credit cards. I was thankful that I kept my Indian currency so that I could pay the baggage excess fee. There is a shop in a remote village that does not accept VISA or an international airline. An accountant would be given a coronary by their handling of cash. You should keep good records of what you pay and who you give it to. I would have said that the antique looking plane I flew from Delhi to Bangladesh was built in the 19th century. The taxi take off and landing noises were unnerving. I don't know where they will put their legs because the seats are small and tight. If the passenger in front of you decides to recline back into your lap and face, I was struggling to find a place to put mine. I don't think I could have read a book on the flight. There was not enough room for one. The pages would have burst into flames due to the extremely hot temperature inside the cabin and there was no air circulation which made it seem even hotter. Natural padding won't be found in the seats if you don't have it. You should not have to use the restroom during the flight. Most seem to have missed their target over the years. I expected to look back at the dirty windows and see the debris from the engines and luggage that was spread out behind the aircraft as we taxied off the runway. I hoped my return flight would be better after arriving two and a half hours late. I didn't have much hope for a better flight back to Delhi after reading the negative comments on this web forum. I was hoping that I would survive. Biman flights experiencing 50 hour delays in New York and multi day delays in Europe did not encourage me. You should walk instead of flying if anyone ever suggests it. You will have to reconfirm your return flight at least 72 hours before your flight is canceled. It may be a good thing or a bad thing. Biman has a lot of hassle with confirmation. It took me six tries; once by phone, twice at their office in Chittagong, and once at a travel agency. The lines at the Biman office were long and not moving, maybe they had staff working the counter, or maybe it was hard to tell, but there were a lot of people waiting in the dark room. I had to leave the Biman office in Chittagong because I ran out of time. I went to the Biman ticket counter at the airport but they couldn't confirm my ticket. My return ticket was reconfirmed by a local friend. I don't think it makes sense to have to confirm tickets that have already been purchased. The return flight was better than the first one. I had a good experience at the check out counter. I was surprised that my excess baggage fee was less than what I paid on my first flight, since I had more luggage on this flight. The flight arrived in Delhi on time. Some friends flew from Mumbai to Bangladesh and their flight was fourteen hours late. The flight was not full because the plane was old. I had an open seat which allowed me to spread my legs out. The food was not as good as the first flight but I have not gotten sick. During take off and landing the cabin temperature was comfortable. The air temp during the flight was so hot that it was too hot for my taste. I did not use the restroom on this flight. I will not fly with Biman again. I won't be on their planes in the future because of the tight seating space, excessive baggage fees, and the reconfirmation hassles. When you are in Bangladesh, fly on another airline. The few dollars saved with Biman Bangladesh Airlines are not worth it.",Mixed,,
"A business class. The flight was delayed for two hours. The smell of fuel lingered on the plane. Business class seat covers are in tatters. There is a seat configuration on an airbus. The seat pitch is poor, it's 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 888-270-6611 Biman's trademark 'Mango Bar' is quite good, but inflight service is minimal. There was an ok flight, but nothing to write home about. Biman's aircrafts are terrible. I don't think Biman will be buying a new fleet of B777s and A330s any time soon. Biman should get its act together as soon as possible.",Mixed,,
"London-Dhaka-Sylhet. We booked a group of 17 months in advance. One of the last people to board the plane was us after check-in. The flowery seat covers on the plane looked like they were from the 70s. The National Express coaches in England look a lot smarter than this. There was a lot of confusion with seating and my family was split up they wanted my 4yr old daughter and my 3yr old son to sit some distance away from us the crew constantly said let us take off then you can swap seats with anyone. A compromise was found with another family. The flight was on time. I don't think entertainment was bad, but they should improve the look of the planes interiors, or they are going to lose a lot of business to other carriers. Biman doesn't allow any other international flights to land in Sylhet, so it's the only reason a lot of people use it.",Mixed,,
There is a flight from Dhaka to Bangkok. The service was good but it made a delay. Excellent food. The staff was good. The price was high when I bought it. There was no entertainment screen on the plane.,Mixed,,

"The flight from Coxs Bazar to Dhaka was reprogrammed twice. I went to check with the Regent boarding desk to see if the flight had finished at Dhaka. The flight is not taking off before 4 pm. The review page of Regent Airways did not have a single good customer review. Regent Airways Management does not prioritize anything between their flight timing, customer service, and overall flying experience. Unless the service improves, I will not take another Regent flight.",Mixed,,
"The city of Dhaka to the city of Kolkata. We were stuck in the business class queue for 15 minutes because of their software problems. They checked us out from another counter. Heavy fog delayed the flight by 2.5 hours. Premium food and wi-fi were included in the lounge for the business class ticket. It wasn't much of a problem. We were taken to the airport in a car. Despite paying for business class, our seats were not good. We didn't have a lot of leg room because the galley's wall was in front of us. A passenger fell ill as the plane taxied to the runway. The plane had to return to the runway after dropping off a sick passenger in an ambulance and then go back to its initial position. The plane took off. The food was average. A hot dog, shwarma, and cake was served. The seat was close to the window. The only thing that was available was wi-fi. I was a bit disappointed. After a short flight, I landed in Kolkata.",Mixed,,
Regent Airways takes Dhaka to Singapore. The check-in at Dhaka was better than my other check-in experiences. The plane had signs of aging. The interior needs some work. The meal could have been better. The cabin crew was helpful. It is difficult to kill time in the cabin. Overall value for money.,Mixed,,
"Although the air conditioning on Regent's Dash 8 aircraft frequently doesn't work, I have flown with them a couple of times and have found them to be OK. I have flown with Regent twice on their new plane. When they say new, it means new for them as both aircraft are leased from other airlines and are starting to show signs of age. Only one of them has an onboard entertainment system which didn't work when I was on board and the other aircraft still has ash trays in the arm rests which have been taped up to stop people from using them but on a lot of the seats. The last time I was back to Bangladesh, the Pilot went AWOL and was almost 2 hours late. The meals on board are not good and you can't get an alcoholic drink on board. The tea and coffee is not good. Efficiency is not the high point of the FA's. Their prices are very good despite their flaws.",Mixed,,
On June 12 there will be a Bombardier Dash-8-Q300 flight from Cox's Bazar to Dhaka. It was possible to purchase domestic Bangladeshi flights from the UK using a UK debit card. Customer service personnel in Bangladesh were very helpful over the phone. Check out the breeze. FAs provided snacks and beverages in the cabin. The flight left on time.,Mixed,,
Jashore to Bangladesh. There is a domestic airline in Bangladesh. The flight was late but we got to our destination in a straight flight. The cabin service was adequate for a short flight. Not a bad airline!,Mixed,,
"I like flights that are comfortable, strange, and angry. The circumstances are mixed. Even though the plane is ready for boarding, there are still many passengers making phone or video calls. This could disrupt the aircraft's navigation system.",Mixed,,
"Good flight schedule, comprehensive online booking interface, serve a snack on the flight no matter how long the flight is.",Mixed,,
"It's an average airline to fly, recently they are not maintaining time. In flight entertainment is poor.",Mixed,,
This airline doesn't maintain time. They never inform passengers if they change flight times. pilots are very skilled You don't feel like an aircraft landing.,Mixed,,
"I went to Bangladesh from London. Biman needs to improve on having more direct flights from Sylhet to London because I had to go to Bangladesh and stay at a disgusting hotel. I flew from Dhaka to London in 11 hours. The new Biman 787-9 was really good and we took it. The seats were comfortable and the windows were tinted. Because it was a new plane, they didn't set the IFE screen, which meant there was no flight entertainment, which was a shame since it was a morning flight and everyone was awake. They still operate a flight live map that will satisfy me but not the kids. I don't mind that our plane was delayed by 2 hours, but the kids... I enjoyed the flight even though I landed in London in the will of Allah. The flight would have been better if they had set everything up.",Mixed,,
Went to Biman after a while. The experience was better than I expected. I flew in one of the leased air crafts of Biman with little leg space and no entertainment. The food was good and the crew service was good.,Mixed,,
"In the absence of Jet Airways, I flew to Delhi and then took Biman Bangladesh Airlines. The flight was old. The staff was very nice. There was no inflight entertainment to pass time. It wasn't a great option to fly but the food was good.",Mixed,,
"They need to improve. Even though it is one of the best airlines in Bangladesh, it still needs to learn some things from other airlines. The flights are comfortable and local.",Mixed,,
"The plane we traveled in had a loud noise. I got a window side seat, but the space was very crowded to get a pleasant journey. Customer satisfaction should be ensured by authority working on the sound issue.",Mixed,,
You don't have a money problem. Biman airways is only for low budget flights.,Mixed,,
"If you have limited time for your travels, all alternatives are less convenient. The plane is comfortable and simple to use. Everything else is standard and the food is ok.",Mixed,,
"The boarding was similar to other airlines. There was a serious need for an interior-refurb. The seats were old. Some seats had broken entertainment- system controls. My wife's screen was stuck on a blank full brightness display for the whole flight with no way to change or switch off. The loos were in dire need of updating. The soap dispensers were barely working. When I requested something basic like a cup of water, the staff seemed overwhelmed and inattentive but friendly. They didn't offer my toddler any friendly encouragement or the usual game to keep him occupied, nor did I see any other cistern on the flight get any friendly attention from the staff. The meals were decent. The only saving grace of this Biman route is that it was non-stop to Sylhet so we didn't need to deal with all the other things.",Mixed,,
"I want everyone to try out the new plane by Biman Bangladesh Airline, it is wonderful service, very pleasant, and compared to past Biman Airline staff, they were very arrogant and stack up, I like the change of air bus and crew member.",Mixed,,
"A small aircraft was given to us. The flight had no delays. The cabin wasn't comfortable. The engine noise made my journey bad. I have never seen a lady of her age before. There was juice, water, half cake and half sandwich. I don't mind what age the crew is because they are caring.",Mixed,,
"In December of last year, we took off on time. Biman's new plane has business class on it. Service was good. There are seats that are comfortable. The new aircraft was dirty and broken. Things degrade very quickly here. This is a good deal if you can guarantee the new aircraft and on time departure. Biman is almost always late, aircraft can't be guaranteed, and this new craft is a mess. 6 out of 10 is based on a cheap price.",Mixed,,
"I don't think this is my preferred airline to travel to Bangladesh, but it has a direct flight to Dhaka which other airlines don't.",Mixed,,
"My flight was delayed for three hours, it was the first time I flew with Biman. The aircraft was good, but the cabin crew needs to be more professional. They should be better than a budget carrier because they are a national carrier. There is a lot of room to improve.",Mixed,,
The staffs are friendly and the flight service was good. The back pocket of the front seat was dirty and there was a missing manual. Food was good. The airport services are good.,Mixed,,
The flight schedule was the best part of Biman lately. cabin crews need to be more courteous. They were very annoyed most of the time. The person next to me didn't get a cup of coffee due to their carelessness.,Mixed,,
"You can get good rates if you buy early at Biman Bangladesh. The rates are less expensive than other airlines. The baggage weight allowance is crazy 35 for economy and 45 for business, have not seen any other airline give that kind of allowance. Bring your own snacks, download some videos or movies on the internet, and you will be set. Don't expect much from the air flight attendants, some are ride, some are nice, but all of them are poorly trained.",Mixed,,
"We checked in at the airport and the crew was waiting for us even if we were late. The flight was perfect, and even if it was only 40 minutes long, we were offered a sandwich and beverage. The flight was on time and the crew was professional.",Mixed,,
"It's convenient that the airline flies direct to my destination. On the way back is terrible, as it makes stop over and waiting time is too long, and early flight is not good for me. It's just an average airline.",Mixed,,
"Timing is the most common issue with Biman Bangladesh. Flight arrives late and leaves late. Don't take a connecting flight if you're thinking of doing so. The In-flight attendants are rude. The food is good, but there is more work to be done.",Mixed,,
Biman Bangladesh airlines service is good. The air hostess is friendly. The average is everything.,Mixed,,
I just wanted a direct flight to dhaka without a stop and it would double the travel time. The reception was great. Business class service and food was excellent. Soft drinks and juices would lose customers. The headphones were great at keeping out noise and the IFE was good. There is a main negative point. I was going to fly them again.,Mixed,,
The flight was delayed due to late arrival and the cabin crew was very courteous.,Mixed,,
"The service was efficient. The flight was on time, and the staff was friendly. The economy class seats were crowded, but it's normal for low cost flights around the world.",Mixed,,
The service is reliable despite the airline being a bit congested. It is good if it needs a bit of an upgrade in terms of interior maintenance. People can pass time in the in-flight movies.,Mixed,,
"It's true that it has a bad reputation in providing services, but I may have gotten an above average service.",Mixed,,
A small airline. Does not have enough leg space. The passengers had trouble with their luggage. Staffs were willing to work together. The taste of the food was average. There was a long queue at the toilet. The flight was delayed for 10 minutes. There were a limited number of movies. They gave a headphones as well.,Mixed,,
"The pilots are great, big planes, but they always delay flight times and their food is not good. An older plane model ac wasn't working on the flight that took off from Bangladesh. The flight from coxs to Dhk was great with a newer plane and working ac.",Mixed,,
There is a government service in Bangladesh. Unfortunately they did not give a perfect service. The pilot is very experienced.,Mixed,,
"Biman is a simple airline with an acceptable level of service as long as you don't expect too much. We can't expect that anymore. New planes make the experience more enjoyable. The seats are comfortable for a flight. Biman planes are better at time-keeping and schedules are more reliable, so you shouldn't expect it to be so for the economy price. Biman flight hosts and hostesses disappear after serving food and only return hours later. The flight crew are usually not in a good mood, so be careful with how you interact with them. In these days of political correctness and hurt feelings any raised voices or harsh words directed at them will result in massive problems for you. Don't speak louder. Don't be angry and stay calm. If you want a hassle-free flight to Sylhet, focus on the end result. There's only one way to get to Siberia from the UK. We have nothing else to do. Don't let the flight crew's melancholy affect your trip. They should be allowed to wallow in their depression. I have sympathy with the flight crew, as they can be some of the most uncouth and uncivilised people you will ever come across, but just say 'Thank you' and smile at the appropriate times. Sylhetis are some of the most fascinating and fun people to spend 9 hours on a plane with. If you can, don't use the loos. The loos are not usable after a few hours. Your real problems will begin as soon as you land in Sylhet, so use the time to watch a movie, get some sleep and save energy. Biman personal is one of the crooks in airports. In Bangladesh, criminals who are in jail are given uniforms and jobs in the airports. Don't trust any of the bandits and be wary. If you go away from the banditry of the airport, you'll discover that Sylhet and Bangladesh are the most beautiful places you can visit. The juxtaposition of modernity and innovation with old and classical traditions is depicted. The local people will welcome you with open arms and offer assistance. The people in Biman Bangladesh Airlines and the airports do not represent the best of Bangladesh. I would recommend Biman Bangladesh Airlines for the sole reason that they operate the only direct flight to Sylhe. There is only one alternative at the time of writing. 9 hours after you get on the plane you're in Sylhet. I am very thankful for that.",Mixed,,
"Biman Bangladesh Airlines is good for domestic routes according to me, but never traveled out of Bangladesh, so I can't tell about it. The price of this airlines is reasonable. There are timing issues and delays of the time.",Mixed,,
"The flight was re-scheduling a night before we were supposed to leave, but we didn't know, the check in was smooth, and we got lunch at the airport lounge. It was a smooth flight. The seats and comfort were average. There was no in flight entertainment.",Mixed,,
The check in counter at Kolkata Airport was not very good and the service man and the supervisor woman were not helpful at all.,Mixed,,
"Don't get me wrong, it is business class, but not as you know it! If you are used to other carriers. It is the only direct flight from LHR to DAC, with a 1hr stop in sylet, and for 1K and change, it is hard to complain. The seats on the aircraft are almost flat for sleeping. The food is cheap compared to what you would expect from a business class meal. The Bollywood films are much more modern and better quality than the western films that are provided in the 10inch screen in the seat in front. If you own a set of headphones, use them with your own set, because they crackle lots. It's rarely possible to charge up with theusb in seat. The only complaint I have is that the staff seem to think that they are doing you a favour by allowing you onto their plane. If you're a frequent visitor of Bangladesh, I don't pay much attention, but if you're on your first trip with Biman, they are very friendly and helpful, just look past the time it takes for them to do anything. I travel Biman on average three times a year, and I recommend the national carrier of Bangladesh for both work and tourist visits. The flight from London to Bangladesh will be delayed by around 2 hours. It's never on time! When you leave for the UK, security at Dhaka is very intensive, so prepare for a long Security queue on the way back.",Mixed,,
"Biman was an emotional choice when returning from Umrah. It was difficult to accept service. After boarding, the cabin was too hot to start the AC without the engine starting. It had to sustain for a while. Didn't like the food at all. The flight was delayed for an hour. Biman lags a lot in terms of service compared to other careers. Hope that Biman will serve and regain its glory.",Mixed,,
"It has a lot of leg room. Our bus transport back in Zimbabwe is better on those fronts, besides that the rest is just average.",Mixed,,
Biman bangladesh airlines. This airline company has a good service. The food was good. Don't check in counter staff that are smart.,Mixed,,
"I traveled with my family and relatives by this airline. The craft was clean, the crews were helpful, and the food was good. The passengers were filthy and the toilets were filthy.",Mixed,,
"Words you don't want to hear on a plane are: ""Inshallah, we will arrive in Bangladesh"". Biman Bangladesh Airlines partly transcribed from English into Bengali. Shahjalal International Airport in Bangladesh is the main hub.",Mixed,,
Everything was expected. The plane was old and small. The service and food were good. Baggage handling was slow.,Mixed,,
I use business class flight because of the good price. The service is okay. It's also good to have a good food selection. Entertainment isn't up to the mark.,Mixed,,
"Biman has many criticisms about the service, mainly for lack of on time departures, but the flight I took to KL was fine. The plane was clean. The food was good but the portion was less. The flights are delayed because there are not enough planes in the fleet. There are many flights that are delayed due to bad weather or mechanical issues. I would fly Biman again if the fare was low and the schedule was convenient.",Mixed,,
There are lots of complaints about this airline. I've been on multiple flights and have seen both good and bad. Worst thing would be flight delays and not so helpful staffs and the best thing would be friendly helpful staffs with nice experiences. It's not certain what kind of service you'll get. Things are getting better recently in my experience.,Mixed,,
"Bangladesh Biman are trying to make improvements if they want to attract a more diverse passenger group and shake off their reputation for poor customer service. The attitude and performance of the cabin crew were good, despite the fact that my flight out from LHR left 30 minutes late. There was no apology or clear announcements on the return journey, with cabin staff disinterested and an unattractive menu. Priority boarding for business class passengers is not organised. Biman's main problem is that they can't provide consistency or continuity in standards, and you never know what quality and standard of journey it will prove to be. If they are ever to deliver a comparable brand and service to most other other flying in/out of Dhaka, they must have a more corporate strategy. Good value for money on a business/executive class ticket is one of its strong points.",Mixed,,
The seat is comfortable and the flight service is excellent. Economy passengers queue with priority boarding passengers for boarding. There isn't a fast track pass for immigration.,Mixed,,
"The last time I traveled by this airline, I missed my trip to Thailand because of the two hours late departure. Average in flight service. It was a smooth take off and landing. Timing is not a bad experience.",Mixed,,
"The office in Kathmandu seems to be stuck in the 90's, the price is cheap, but lack of safety, organization, and nothing serious is taken seriously. I want brazilians to think twice before booking them. The plane was old but the crew was friendly.",Mixed,,
"Biman runs a direct flight from London to Bangladesh. It takes between 10 and 12 hours to reach Dhaka. The take-off and landing of Biman is so smooth that I have used it many times. All the Boeings are great but once due to some issues they have rented Turkish airlines and I had breathing issues, the size was a bit smaller than our Boeings, where at the end hours I had breathing issues. I have never called the flight attendants for any issues, but they were fine with their regular duties, and the main problem is with ourselves. The people of Bangladesh are so stupid and careless that they endanger their lives by smoking in the toilets. During the time of landing, passengers are not listening, they are not seated, and they are taking out their cabin luggages, which can cause serious accidents. They fight about who can get off first, is it a local bus or something? When all these passengers are in a hurry, I always keep seated and get off first. The passengers shout for food, block the alleys, and make the toilets dirty. People who work for Biman have a problem. I was in Bangladesh and needed to change the date of my return flight, but the officers said there was nothing left. They asked for bribes and offered seats. I have to return to London. The flight was not full at all and they lied about the seats. We are two so I like to book 3 seats in a row. You can keep some movies in your gadgets when the TV in the back seat doesn't work. It isn't great but it isn't bad.",Mixed,,
"Biman takes a half an hour trip from KOL to the other side of the country. The last time I was on this route with Biman, he was so bad that the flight was suddenly delayed. I was supposed to reach Dhaka after 9 pm. It was a safety issue for a solo traveler. Fortunately, I was able to get a cab to leave the airport after midnight. It's Damn! Standard service is expected from an International airlines in the near future.",Mixed,,
The only direct flight from Bangladesh to London is this one. Biman flew us from London to Bangladesh with my wife. The service was good.,Mixed,,
"There is a review about the CCU-RGN route. This is the most economical and efficient route you can take if you want to reach Myanmar from India. The route has potential due to the fact that there should be a lot of Indian tourists after it opens up. Passengers don't get stranded because the connecting flights were delayed. We were more than fine with this deliberate delay. We paid 14500 for each round ticket. Not cheap (compared to European no frills airlines for the distance), but considerably cheaper than competition like Air India. Food was okay - I no longer look at quantity/quality parameters for food in economy flights on most airlines in the world. Great food is provided in such flights.",Mixed,,
I didn't get the larger airbus because it was used for Hajj flight. The first row of economy seats gave us a bit more space than other seats. The seats are small and not very comfortable.,Mixed,,
"The flight was delayed for a couple of hours. Biman is still late at times, but it has recently recovered from its reputation of being always late. I love the food they serve and I expect better service in terms of ground and luggage handling. I think that in-flight attendants could be a little more careful with passenger demands.",Mixed,,
Older planes have more space than newer planes. Older planes have nicer interiors but are small. Food and service are good.,Mixed,,
The aircraft is very old. The interior is shabby. A less expensive carrier will allow you to forget about other short comings.,Mixed,,
"The aircraft was clean and the bites on board were ok, but the major issue was the mosquitos inside the aircraft prior to take off from Dhaka to Kolkata. The boarding process and transit boarding was messy, but value for money, considering that other airlines for these sectors were expensive.",Mixed,,
The airline is flying with an old type aircraft. They have agreed to allow me an extra 8 kilograms of luggage for free.,Mixed,,
"I had to run to catch my return flight because the plane interior was old and not well maintained, there was no leg room, and the flight was delayed more than 3 hours. The food tasted good, I'm just hungry. The crews on this flight were very accommodating, helpful and super nice; they were always smiling and asking you if you need something. The flight attendants are very nice and treat the passengers the same.",Mixed,,
Biman is very sad. Several times I flew in a DC-10. It was at least 30 years old. There are insects in the aircraft and orange cloth on the seats. The price was right.,Mixed,,
Biman operates a plane in this route. The seats were comfortable. The journey was a bit bumpy but the air craft was ok. Flight crews were good but not for everyone. Food was average. I was told they were not carrying any duty free items.,Mixed,,
I was impressed with the quality of the aircraft. The cabin crews were not very nice. They will be even better if they improve the behavior of the cabin crews.,Mixed,,
"Inflight service is good when there is a flight delay. Customer service is great. There are comfortable seats. If the flight is not domestic, you can take this airline to London and New York.",Mixed,,
The Cabin crew needs to be more trained.,Mixed,,
"The flight was bumpy because of the weather service, but the problem was the leg room, my seat number was 19",Mixed,,
"I bought the airline ticket because it was cheaper than other airlines. Both flights were delayed. The temperature was high on both flights, but it became cooler after the first flight.",Mixed,,
There are aircraft on the domestic routes. The seating was comfortable and the noise was not loud. Passengers on this flight get hot sandwich. It's not bad.,Mixed,,
"I am a frequent traveler and had my first travel experience with US Bangla. The price is the reason why US bangla is chosen in this sector. I feel like the aircraft is older than it is. The Training of the Pilot, I have never felt the landing of that much from Dhaka to CAN, it was on average. The authority should take care of the issues that are important to me.",Mixed,,
"Their check in station is chaotic and awful. It wasn't smooth. One side wheel touched turmac and them both. It wasn't very common. I don't know why, but it was frightening.",Mixed,,
It was the worst experience at the airport. Food was not provided when the flight was delayed. The staff was rude and aggressive. Not worth a discount flight.,Negative,,
"It was my first time in Bangladesh and the last time I traveled from London due to COVID. The staffs at the gate harassed me because I had enough allowance and I only had a small bag hand so they could allow 2 kilo more in my luggage rather than asking for extra money. The gate flight supervisor at London Heathrow airport terminal 2 was very rude, she didn't even try to listen to what I was saying, she said just to save your time, and that like she didn't even try to listen to what I was trying to say. The cabin crew were well behaved but you can't find cabin crew during quiet time as they are always in their station but they were well behaved. I didn't like the gate staffs and would have slapped the lady supervisor if she had behaved like we pay for service and want to get that service we do not travel for free or with their fathers money. I wanted to jump out of the plane because the food was late, they need to give food on time. Staffs who don't know how to behave with passengers should not be hired. I am a tourism and hospitality employee at a fairmont hotel in London and I have trained air hostesses from Saudi airlines, do I know how passengers should be treated? Thank you for your interest in giving more training to customer service staff at the airport. The staffs at the luggage desk are always gossiping and the cabin crews are not very attentive.",Negative,,
I will never fly with this airline because it is too dirty inside and the sit service is terrible.,Negative,,
"The airlines run by stupid people are the worst. They don't have a sense of time or service. If you ask for help, even if they don't know it, they will give you terrible suggestions which will ruin your life and you will realize their suggestion was unnecessary. I had no other choice but to fly with them and I wish I never did that again. They are rude to let you think they are monsters.",Negative,,
I called the airline because I heard about it. Twice they hung up on me. You're only allowed to ask one question. They saved me from flying with a bad company. Thank you so much. I will not fly this airline. I didn't fly with them. They wouldn't allow me to write a review without mentioning a flight.,Negative,,
The flight will be delayed one hour in this situation. That's right! Toder mamar bari ai desh ta. Kuttar bacchar dhol.,Negative,,
"I tried to pay online several times. The online Card payment gateway seems to be malfunctioning. It can't be a browser issue because I've tried from a number of browsers. I've called their helpline many times and tried to connect to an operator, but every time they disconnected. Their customer service is just as bad as the payment gateway. I think they are flush with business, otherwise they would jeopardize the future of their business with such poor service.",Negative,,
"We had a 6 hour delay as well as terrible food experience, my parents were suffering problems, and this will be my last flight with them in my life!",Negative,,
"I have taken the worst flight in my life, my mother and father were almost divorced because of this.",Negative,,
"I canceled my ticket because the website wouldn't allow me to change my dates, but they gave me an email saying I would get my money back.",Negative,,
"When I and my husband went to the airport to catch the plane for Biman, we were there before 2 hours of the flight. We wanted to talk to someone, but nobody was there, so I called a friend who was an employee of Biman, and she started shouting at me. On the Biman after a year, our suitcase was cut and important and expensive things were stolen, we were confused about what to do, my husband talked to a man in the airport and that man managed the Malaysian airline to take us to KL. The cabin crew behave strange when the AC does not work, and the food is not good. The floor of the Dhaka airport is like a bus station of old days, it is filthy with strange smell and people.",Negative,,
"I was wondering if it was worth it to submit feedback to Biman and its authority since this may not go any further, and if they even do anything with the feedback that they receive. I still believe that it is my duty to share my disappointment and distress that it caused me and my family through this feedback process. If needed, I will raise this with the Aviation Authority. Everyone has better things to do in life if Biman management understands that passengers won't waste time and effort without a valid reason to do so. It upsets me and a lot of other people that you are treated like animals by your own people even though you spend a lot of money to travel with Biman. I took a flight from Sylhet to Bangladesh and then to London on January 16 and 17 of this year. The flight from Sylhet to Dhaka was delayed for 1 hour and 25 minutes. The hotel stay from the airport to the hotel was unbearable. I had to wait outside the airport for almost an hour with my kids for a bus and car because we were bitten by mosquitoes and dehydrated. The hotel representative kept telling us that the bus would be here within 10 minutes even though we had to wait for almost an hour. When we got to the hotel, our biggest surprise was that we didn't know how to get there. The room that was allocated to 6 of us was dirty, smelly and had blood spots on it. My kids were not able to sleep because of bed bugs and mosquitoes. I asked when the dinner would be served and if I could see the owner or the hotel manager, as we were all hungry. In terms of dinners/servings, this was very limited amount of food, only rice, chicken curry, dall and vegetable Bhaji. It felt like we were forcing the attendants for after meal tea refreshment which came at a cost of 50 Taka for 4 cups and we had to wait in the lobby. One point when they were serving drinks where I had 2 of my kids were sitting beside me, I asked them what drink they were having, but they were told to hurry up, so I said WHAT! I get that they have other passengers to serve, but for God sake! They are children. I'm sure they won't treat their kids that way. They don't even ask what we're going to have as a meal, instead they force us to eat chicken curry and rice which we didn't like. I think it's a language barrier, but they don't pose any manners and don't have customer service knowledge, so I hope something is being done.",Negative,,
"The service was poor. After what happened to us, I wouldn't recommend Bangladesh Biman to anyone. The staff made us sit in our seats with someone's poo in the aisle covered with a newspaper sheet as they didn't want us to clean it. As people stepped on it and moved it everywhere with their feet, it spread along the entire aisle. When you press the bell for them to come, they ignore it and you have to get up and get them. Terrible service! As our flight was the next day, they made us stay at a hotel in Dhaka. The hotel called White Rose was dirty, hair all over the bedcovers, floor looked like it hadn't been swept for days, and the fan switch wouldn't work so we were stuck with our three children including our 6 month baby. The mosquitoes were biting us when we tried to turn it off. They only spray aerosol so they have no other options.",Negative,,
"The flight service was one of the worst. unfriendly crews, no smile, and poor service.",Negative,,
Terrible. The food on the plane was not good. Don't use this airline. The hotel they booked for us was filthy and had bugs and flies in the bedrooms. It was so filthy that I couldn't sleep.,Negative,,
"Due to sudden and severe snow, my 2 hour journey took 4 hours. Got to check in with 30 minutes to spare, but wasn't allowed to join the queue as the number of people waiting already meant they would breach check in times, even though the flight was delayed by 3 hours because of the weather. If the Biman office cleared me to board, they would let me check in. The person who received the call checked my ticket and boarding pass, but didn't do anything else. I was left with no choice but to book a hotel and pay for a new ticket after they cleared out the check in area. The flight was delayed for 3 hours due to bad weather. Biman staff at LHR don't give food or drink vouchers like other airlines do. I booked into a lounge as the airport was packed out, but they never refunds me for the cost of food and drinks when the flight is delayed more than 3 hours. In flight movies, the headphones didn't work. Food needs to be better. The staff on the plane were very nice and the attention to customer needs was good. At the end of January, I was forced to buy a new ticket because of their poor service at the airport, but they have never responded to any of my emails. I sent letters to their head office in Bangladesh, but nothing. I gave up chasing them for a response after 6 months and will never fly with them again.",Negative,,
The food was so bad that I didn't eat it.,Negative,,
You need to make your own sandwich. They will give you less food. Other airlines provide food 3 times.,Negative,,
"Biman Airways has the worst airline food I have ever eaten, the food is tasteless, oily, and has no flavour, so they should just serve some sandwiches.",Negative,,
"The airline told us that they operate the new Dreamliner on the route, so we booked in business class. The route has a technical stop in Chittagong. You can't get off the plane in Chittagong if you're going to Dubai. I was willing to fly this route with Biman. Their other planes are very old. The aircraft was a new model. The business class seat was flat. It's not comparable to business class on flagship carriers. 3 business class seats were occupied by snotty, screaming kids with a mother unwilling to control them and flight attendants unwilling to care. Flight attendants tried to calm the kids or help the mother. It was very greasy and sticky. There are items that are unidentifiable. We didn't eat much of it. Biman can't keep a time schedule. They are always late when we fly them. It was remarkable that we left Dhaka 10 minutes late. We arrived in Chittagong 20 minutes late. We were late by 2 hours. We were 2.5 hours late to the airport. We had to pay a rebooking fee for another airline because we missed a connecting flight. The purpose of buying the Biman business class seat was defeated when we lost a night's sleep because we had to wait for the next flight. Biman customer service is terrible. There were no apologies or explanations as we got further behind. There is no alcohol on Biman, even in international business class, but the tardiness of Biman is a huge deterrent. We lost time, money, and sleep in the end. I don't think Biman is a good choice.",Negative,,
"They canceled my flight a week before I left. I had a domestic Biman flight in Bangladesh that I couldn't take back. They said it was my fault I missed the flight, even though the Kathmandu Biman guy said it would be ok. They didn't care that Biman canceled the flight. They don't think they are two separate organizations.",Negative,,
"I used this airline for the first time and was not happy. The flight was delayed and they provided incorrect information. It was said to go to the counter 30 minutes prior to departure, but they closed their counter 40 minutes earlier. The take-off was smooth but the landing was terrible. It's a concern that cleanliness is also a concern. I will think twice about using this airline in the future.",Negative,,
"Planes and monitors have improved. My previous visits included broken monitors and ripped up seats, as well as airport staff trying to bribe me.",Negative,,
The airline lacks organisation and customer service. My dad's flight was delayed for 5 hours. He was offered 15 pound for a meal at the airport. When taking this further with Biman london they kept on giving the buck to someone else. The airline must be avoided.,Negative,,
"Biman Business Class was reviewed. Over the last 3 years, I've flown and reviewed Biman a number of times. I think it has gotten worse. Imagine the economy if business is bad. The bus took us out to the plane, but the plane wasn't ready, so they dumped all passengers on the curb at the foot of the stairs to the plane, and we all stood there for a good 20 minutes outside. Unsafe and disrespectful. The food in the lounge was disgusting and the box in my seat area on the flood was not moved. I kicked it out of my seat. It was just strange and disrespectful. No alcohol, even in business class. Business class row 3 has overhead bins that they use to store a ton of stuff. She spent an hour of the flight rummaging in the bin over my head because there wasn't enough room for a backpack above my business class seat. The flight attendant had to use a butter knife to release the remote from the arm rest. She had never seen the menu before. The flight attendant wiped her nose before serving dinner. The napkins were thrown at us. After take off, I took a full 1.5 hours to get to dinner. Biman offers day-time flights and a cheaper ticket in Business Class. This is one of the worst airlines in the world.",Negative,,
"We had a bad flight with them. The officials at the airport were confused about the extra weight charge. We had to wait almost an hour to clear the check-in. There was a lack of knowledge by the officials. The seats were too crowded on the plane. The cabin crew was neglecting. We tried to call, but no one showed up. They are only available during the day. We will never fly with them.",Negative,,
You can fly with this aircraft from Bangladesh to Singapore. The food was not good. The display in front of me was malfunctioning. The cabin crew couldn't help. The staff was helpful. The check in experience on the return flight was terrible. They couldn't use the automatic check in Singapore because of the long queue. The smell from the bathroom was bad. They must take care of the environment.,Negative,,
"They don't know what rude customer service is, if you ask any they will say ""go and ask the other guy""",Negative,,
"Biman has been used before but not a long time. The baggage allowance was better and the flight was cheaper than other flights. They don't have to try too hard on customer service because they can fill a huge plane every time. I was suspicious when we changed our departure time to an hour earlier. After 30 minutes of waiting there was no staff and the departure time was changed 45 minutes later. We had to hang around after we got checked in because we arrived an hour too early. We were expecting boarding to start when we went to the gate. After an hour, I went back to the desk and was told that the captain had not arrived and that everyone had boarded. We ended up flying an hour and a half late because we were told to come an hour early. There was no apology, no evening mention of delay, and no communication from airline or airport staff. There are 2 very basic meals on the flight. I had been up for 7 hours with nothing but an airport coffee in my stomach and I was given a cup of water. I was in need of a snack when I was staring at my broken screen. I went to the galley because there were no staff in the aisles. I got the water and asked if there were any snacks. I was given a very dry cake and was told it was absolutely free. They don't care if they don't have the international carrier concept.",Negative,,
"Biman has been my third flying experience. Do they care what we write? The airline has always been strange, funny, weird and full of unpleasant surprises. I was flying to Thailand with Biman. The staffs were a bit friendly. That was the first. Most of the time you are not friendly, smiling and helpful. I hope you keep up the good work. The food service seems to be different from the other two. All of the seats on the plane were clean and the meals were well portioned with tea and coffee. It was a whole new experience on the way back. The food was limited to salad and tea. And no TV? No blankets? What is going on with that? That is not fair. We paid full price for the service and should expect it to be perfect. This is for Biman. No other airlines do this. I was looking forward to having my coffee with the cake that came with the meal on the flight back from BKK. Did you completely cancel Tea and Coffee? Is it bad that you can't provide tea for Bangladeshis? You also charge for a wheel chair? What other airlines do that? I was watching a movie on the way to Bangkok and I was enjoying it but at the end I felt like it was over. All got ready for landing when I put away my headphones. You put the movie back on after the ADVERT. It was so annoying that I didn't feel like watching it. Just as we have LANDED, you could have had that ADVERT put. All other airlines do that. You all have the same problem in every aspect. After a few weeks, you all become zero, and you all stay at zero. Staying loyal in the service sector is the key. Regardless of how little or much you give, you have to keep a proper ground. You provide a good meal. I like your food. You are not being consistent. I said earlier that it was something else for the same price. There is a lack of respect and decency in the organization. Is this organization doing something right? The parking lot is a mess. Have you been there? The arrival passengers come with their luggage and wait for their cars. Its ugly and dirty. Is this what an international airport would look like? I can go on INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals INRDeals I feel like that is enough for now.

"The DAC-KUL-DAC flight was late by 11 hours, no notification, and passengers needed to check continuously to see the revised schedule. No hotel was arranged. After we arrived at Calcutta airport, we learned that the return flight was canceled. You can't be sure of timing for the rest, except for DAC-BKK and DAC-SIN and DAC-LHR flights.",Negative,,
"I booked tickets for myself and my wife from Kolkata to Yangon. It was a one way flight to use some spare time. 3-4 days before the journey Biman Kolkata Office informed me that either I have to cancel the tickets as only one hour lay over time is not allowed for international connecting flights, or I may travel a day before to Dhaka, stay there overnight and catch the Yangon flight the following morning. If we paid the transit visa charges, they would arrange for a hotel. The officer at the Kolkata airport told me that everything was taken care of when I asked about our stay. Biman transit desk told us that they couldn't provide us a hotel because they didn't receive any email from the office in Kolkata. They tried to contact the office but didn't succeed. After waiting for four hours, we decided to pay for the hotel from my pocket. Once in the van provided by them they rang up the driver, bought us another one at the airport driveway and told us that they would pay for the hotel stay ourselves. The hotel we're taken into had high handed staff and poor food quality. The driver took us to the airport early in the morning. It was a horrible experience at this age.",Negative,,
This is the last flight with Biman.Rude staff. The food was not good. I will also use other airlines like air India. Your customers service needs to be improved.,Negative,,
"There's nothing worse than travelling on an unsafe airline, sitting next to someone who's just witnessed a crash by the same airline and can't stop talking about it, with air stewards not even doing proper safety checks. A woman sitting next to me is telling me that she witnessed the crash of the Biman plane the day before. She was going to board that plane back to Bangladesh. On our Kathmandu bound flight, at no point did the cabin crew make that extra safety check, let alone check that everyone's seat belts were securely fastened or that the cabin was free from potential obstructions in case of an emergency. The staff was arrogant throughout. There was nothing related to safety. When we sat in the first row after business, the stewardess walked out and said ""You done yet?"" We said we'd just started. I couldn't help but think of the airline's crash the day before, and I noticed the cabin was filthy. I hope that dirt doesn't equate to lower safety, but poor maintenance doesn't help the reputation of the airline. The airline doesn't do much to make passengers feel comfortable.",Negative,,

It is the worst plane and airline service I have ever experienced. The service in Business class was poor. I was able to recline my seat and sleep because the entertainment system did not work both ways. They give you a lot of food in Business class. I didn't like it because it was very oily. When British Airways used to go there, it was cheaper to travel by other airlines as the government didn't like competition. The service is poor and staff don't care. Even though they are the only operator in the airport in Bangladesh, flights are always delayed and never on time. They don't have direct flights from Sylhet to London, instead they transit via Dhaka, where the staff hassle you a lot saying unless you pay them, your luggage will not make it to its destination. The doggy politician want to make some money for themselves by making passengers stay in their hotel, so they make you stay over night in Dhaka, even if you're travelling from Sylhet. I went to the Sylhet office to confirm my ticket and also to confirm that my father would get a wheel chair. I had to pay them to confirm that there will be a wheel chair. Really. Even if I travel economy, I will pay extra to stay in business class as seating is better and there is hot food and drink. They won't push my dad unless I pay them. I gave them five dollars, but they wanted more. They start to push him to the plane when I give them 10 pounds. I have been complaining since I came back to the UK, but no one has responded. I don't like going to Bangladesh because of the travel.",Negative,,
I was supposed to go back to Bangladesh the next day. It was the last Biman flight of the day. The flights were canceled just an hour before.,Negative,,
"The whole thing was terrible and worthless. Do the improvement of the national airlines compare to other airlines? Even though we only travel for 35 minutes, the food, service, and cabin condition were terrible. ?",Negative,,
"We traveled from London to Bangladesh with Biman for the first time and this would be our last trip. We have traveled to 42 countries around the world and used over 200 flights. 1. The crews did not take action despite the request to do so. The cabin crews need more training. Two teenage children sat with their family members differently. 4. In twelve hours, there was one main meal and one snack. It should be at least two snacks. There were delays for nearly three hours. A newly wed couple from London missed their flight because the flight was over booked. Biman is free if you don't care about delay, missing the flight for overbooking, or splitting up the family seating arrangements. Bangladesh Biman is far behind other basic airlines. We will never use the Biman again.",Negative,,
"I was happy to find a new plane for our flight that day. The seats are too small when inside. There were 9 seats in a row. The cabin crew's service is not good. They were doing their job, but not in a professional way. The steward put the food in the trolly. Some trays with unfinished mill and garbage were pushed hard by him. The roll out made a mess in front of my seat. The stained path area was awful even though he cleaned it. I had to sit next to that area for the rest of the flight. The steward tried to close the trolly door by kicking. Maybe they broke the locks of the food trolly. The other hostess was old and could not walk. The suggestion is 1. The seats in the plane should be similar to the ones in the plane. It should be well trained and supervised.",Negative,,
"The flight was brought forward by an hour so it will leave at 9am instead of 10am. After we were taken out of the business lounge, we were stuck in the board area for 2 1/2 hours and refused to go back to the lounge. Everyone was made to suffer because the plane wasn't ready. My parents were punished without water because of their medical conditions. The only reason we paid for business was to give my parents peace of mind. The elderly and disabled passengers were in tears. Bengalis should know that the airline they are paying for should not exist. The international aviation service should do something about Biman. I will never travel with Biman again.",Negative,,
"Flight service was terrible, the flight was delayed for 6 hours, meaning it was longer on this plane. A one way flight costs over $600. It was wrong and awful to initially book this because of being a direct flight and needing to come back asap. Even though there is a stop in Dubai with waiting time, it's always a good idea to stick with Emirates.",Negative,,
"People travel like a bus, keeping luggage, and blocking leg space. An aircraft plays azaan. Azaan is considered a religious sentiment but why should someone block leg spaces?",Negative,,
"The airlines are the worst ever. Don't get any star at all. The flight was delayed for 4 hours without any notice from Biman Management and no compensation at all. Correct your services from ground staff, customer service representative and crew. Not satisfied with the service. Shame!",Negative,,
The only reason I flew with them was because they were the only airline that could fly from London. Most seats had a broken screen so there was no entertainment. The seats were very hard and there was no leg room. My legs were swollen at the end of the journey so I won't be travelling with them again. The flight was delayed for 4 hours.,Negative,,
Biman crew were out of class. The service was very bad. They need to improve a lot.,Negative,,
"The window frame was loose, the seats were filthy, and the entertainment panel was smashed, it was one of the worst airlines going.",Negative,,
The flight was on time. That didn't surprise me. The journey was full of surprises. They gave a small plane for the journey. Biman doesn't mention what aircraft will be provided. The Dash 8 has a loud sound in it's cabin. It was very painful. I've found a man in the role of a cabin crew. They seem to be ignoring the cabin service. There was a family on the flight. The cabin crew was the focus. They served a piece of cake and a juice for the journey. Biman needs to take care of the customer service more.,Negative,,
The flight was delayed for over four hours. I missed my flight.,Negative,,
"3 hours before our departure, we arrived at the airport. We were surprised to see our flight listed as 9:00pm on the big check-in board. The check-in desk confirmed that the flight was five hours late and the aircraft had not yet left. We were able to wait in the Miracle Lounge for the whole time because we were in Business Class. This is not acceptable. The food in Business Class was terrible. They must have taken this off the street. It was revolting. We ate in the Miracle Lounge. The return flight from BKK-DAC did not feature the brand new Dreamliner that was on last week's flight from DAC-BKK. It was a piece of an old plane. Business class seats were not comfortable. They don't use the Dreamliner every day, so don't book this route thinking you'll get it. Biman is hit-or-miss and I've flown it many times. This time it was a big miss.",Negative,,
The last flight by Biman Bangladesh Airines will be on December 20th. The plane from Kuala Lumpur to Bangladesh stops in India for 5 hours because of bad weather and passengers are not given entertainment or food. The passengers were tired and angry. I only have 15 minutes to travel from Bangladesh to Kathmandu. My baggage was lost when I arrived in Kathmandu. I am angry and have no solutions as my baggage is back.,Negative,,
"I will never take Biman airlines again. The hotel had to change rooms 3 times because it was overrun with roaches and rats. Biman and airport staff try to make money by giving misinformation. Biman staff only know how to make money out of people's misfortune. They didn't inform us of the cancellation of the flight until we got to the airport. Airport staff were very rude. The staff member was lying when he said that the suitcases were weighed inaccurately in order to charge us a ridiculous amount. They had the cheek to ask for money for their inaccurate weighing, instead of paying us for the canceled flight. The manner in which they spoke was threatening and they were mocking and laughing at the misery they were putting us through. The staff at hand luggage security tried to throw away my facial cleanser without my consent. When I was being searched by a female member of staff at the airport, she was more interested in her phone than she was in looking at me. What kind of security is this? I travel to Bangladesh often and love the country but the Biman airline is not for foreigners. I don't want to go to Bangladesh again because of experiences like these, I feel so proud and happy to be a British Citizen. It's always a good idea to take an airline that's friendly to Bangladesh. Biman staff will make you endure disgusting and uneducated behavior, but a stop-over and 5 hour drive to Sylhet definitely outweighs that. !",Negative,,
"The plane was old and had no in-flight entertainment system, the cabin crew was rude and the food was terrible.",Negative,,
"When you want to get a direct flight into Sylhet, Bangladesh, I don't get it. There is only one way to go. I am sorry, there is just too many things wrong, and I just can't list them all.",Negative,,
"The airline is the worst to travel with. They don't allow other aircrafts to travel to Sylhet. It's time for people to boycott this stupid airline and demand change as nothing has changed over the years. I have no idea how and why this is being allowed to fly, as the service to time keeping is terrible, but you wouldn't expect this in the 21st century. Avoid this airline at all costs. I wouldn't have given them a score if I could.",Negative,,
I don't think anyone should travel this airline because it's not professional and they don't know how to care for customers. It looks like you are being held hostage. I feel bad when we stop at sylhet airport because they start cleaning inside the flight and there are lots of passengers in it.,Negative,,
"It was their first time flying. The delay of 2 hours on my first flight from Yangon to Dhaka was a waste of time. The flight from 45 minutes to Kolkata was delayed for 3 hours, 4 hours and 5 hours. I was treated as rubbish by the staff when I asked for lounge access for this delay. I am going to tell you not to fly with them because they won't tell you why they are delayed. They don't care about refunds or giving anything to you. This was the last time I flew with Binman Airlines and it was the worst experience of my life.",Negative,,
"The flight was over booked and we saw two passengers get given air hostess seats which I am pretty sure was not meant to happen. When passengers feel unwell, the staff doesn't help them. A mother who had a child that was airsick was left to deal with it on her own and not one person came to ask if he wanted help. Life would be easier if Bangladesh allowed other airlines to fly to Sylhet. Biman would have no customers left. !",Negative,,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines is the only direct flight allowed into Sylhet. You are going to be in for a very difficult 10 hours. There is no direct flight back and there is a 4/6 delay in Dhaka. The quality of customer service in the cabin is poor compared to other carriers. We need to improve or give alternatives.,Negative,,
Terrible service. The flights were delayed. There was no food or a sorry. It was late for my flight. Still waiting for a reply.,Negative,,
Nothing to be amazed at. Taking the bus would take more time than a flight. The time required for boarding off was less than the actual flight lasted. We had to wait for half an hour because there wasn't a bus. Some began to walk. Didn't expect much. They may have forgotten to turn on the AC.,Negative,,
"We were on our way to Kolkata. Despite paying for a wheelchair facility, no transport was provided. My brother had difficulty walking and was taken to the aircraft in a transport. A wheelchair with blood on it was provided on the way back after an argument. Business Class had five passengers. Two cars and a microbus were near the aircraft when we arrived in Bangladesh. I told the Biman official that my brother had difficulty with his legs and a car would be more suitable, but he was not allowed to share any of the cars. I told the driver that the two men were not in Business Class because it was hard for my brother to get in. The driver told me to go in the car after an unpleasant exchange. I told him we wouldn't do that. The transport was meant for us. Each time I told the driver to go, he kept standing until he picked up a group of people, including a young boy. I told the group that they were not in Business Class and that we were waiting for them. The lady said that she was Capt Ishtiaq's wife. Everything is justified if you are a person.",Negative,,
"I prefer the government owned Bangladesh Biman. They have more flights than any other airline. heir timing is the best for tourists in Nepal. Their timing was okay so far, with a 30 minutes delay. Their food service is a joke.",Negative,,
6 hour delays are normal. I am still trying to get compensation for 7 passengers one year later. Do not travel with him.,Negative,,
Biman has been flown by me a few times. It's either hit or miss. This time it wasn't there. The plane was at least 30 years old. It was Filthy. There are broken parts. The seats are thin. A flight attendant has a frown. Food is not good. 45 minutes late. It took over an hour to get luggage. I don't recommend.,Negative,,
There was an hour and a half delay when I booked a direct flight from Heathrow to shylet and they said there was something wrong with the plane.,Negative,,
"One of the worst airlines ever, starting from ground services up to boarding, my booking was in business class and was confirmed but later on the airline decided to change the aircraft to single category flight with economy class only without notifying the passengers and offcorse with no refunds also!!) When I arrived at the airline counter at the airport, the way it was handled was a nightmare, I might need a full page to describe the unprofessional and worst customer services I have ever experienced. I think it's time to talk about my horrible experiences with this airline from top to bottom.",Negative,,
I was traveling with my family. My baby fell out of the seat and injured his head because of the carelessness of the passengers. The cabin crew members were trying to hide something.,Negative,,
The plane was terrible on the way back. The seats were dirty. The food was bad. The crew doesn't have control over the passengers.,Negative,,
"When you have the option to fly with other airlines, buying a ticket on this airlines is complete waste of money. Customer service was horrible and the interior was dirty.",Negative,,
"I don't like giving out 1 star reviews because every experience usually has some sort of redeeming factor to it, however my experience with Bangladesh Biman was so bad I feel like a 1 star rating is too generous. I booked a domestic flight from Sylhet to Dhaka so that we could catch a 10:00am flight to Delhi. We arrived at the airport in good time and were checked in. The boarding pass stated that the flight would leave at 6:30pm. There was a sign that said the flight was delayed and the estimated time of departure was 07:30am. It was1-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-65561-6556 The plane arrived at the gate at 07:30 after 7.20 came and went. It was not until 08:20 that the plane began to board, and it was looking like we would miss our flights. Biman staff were not available to speak and no explanation was given for the delay. Biman staff on the tarmac were busy ferrying passengers travelling to London on to one bus while putting all other passengers on another bus when we arrived in Bangladesh. We did not arrive at the domestic terminal until 09:15hrs and by the time we had collected our bags and arrived at the international terminal our flight had already boarded. It was the first time in my life that I had met someone who didn't care about me. She didn't apologize for the delay, she didn't acknowledge the fact that the delay resulted in us missing our flights, and she didn't offer any solutions. She kept repeating that it was not the fault of Bangladesh Biman that I had booked tickets with their airline and that I should have expected delays. After realizing that your member of staff was not willing to assist me, I was forced to purchase tickets to fly to Kolkata from Dhaka at an additional cost of BDT 25,330. I had to wait in the arrivals area of the terminal with my 2 children for 7 hours because the earliest flight was at 19:20hrs. After the 19.20pm flight was delayed, we boarded at 20:30hrs. I had to pay for a hotel in Kolkata because there were no connecting flights to Chennai. The arrogance of the staff member at the Bangladesh Biman desk was astounding, there was no reasoning with her and she was not going to even listen to the points I was making. I have complained to Bangladesh Biman, but they have the monopoly over flights coming in and out of Sylhet, so I am sure my words will be dismissed in an arrogant manner as to the way I was treated by their representative.",Negative,,
The flight was terrible. The seats were small. The flight was full and the staff was disorganized. It's sad how SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA are SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA SALVAGEDATA Not flying economy with biman again.,Negative,,
"The plane was dirty and smelled bad, but the attendants did a good job and we arrived safely. I don't know if there are other options between cities, but I wouldn't fly Biman again.",Negative,,
"I'm not sure if it's true or not. I'm not sure if it's true or not. The flight was fine, 11 hours, take off, flight, landing, all great. But service? Flight attendants are not present. I had to find them to get water. You get 1 meal and 1 snack on this flight. If you are unlucky like me, there is no inflight entertainment because all their screens don't work. It was the same on my flight. The flight was not cheap because Biman is the only airline with direct flight. The flight back to Dhaka was a full one, as everyone from London is flying back to Sylhet. The flight takes 9 hours to arrive at sylhet, then 1 hour at sylhet, and then 20 minutes to arrive at dhaka. If the inflight service was improved it would be a kickin' flight.",Negative,,
Their seats are dirty and crowded. There isn't any room for leg space. They do not have in-flight entertainment options. I am not happy with their service at all.,Negative,,
"I was issued a different seat during the return flight after I chose my seats on their website, but I wasn't told about it by the check-in counter staff. I didn't realize until I reached boarding gate that my main luggage was selected for random screening twice in a row, it didn't feel random anymore but more like an arbitrary decision by the same counter staff. I was told that I couldn't use the mileage from my membership card to access the lounge even though it was on their website. The staff suggested that I speak with their supervisor but without giving further directions and I was left to deal with this by myself.",Negative,,
"The flight was displayed on time and there was no sign of the plane, but it continued past the planned boarding time. It was frustrating because you couldn't be sure of true boarding time. The flight was not great to write about. Think it could do better.",Negative,,
"The service is poor, the flight attendants are rude, and one of the dodgiest airlines around will con you over and over again. In flight entertainment doesn't work.",Negative,,
I was asked to pay 100 dollars for a wheelchair. My disabled son was crying for over an hour and no one helped him. I felt like I was breaking down because I couldn't afford a wheelchair. No one helped me. I couldn't trust anyone. My son was crying on the plane. People in these airlines don't care about anything other than money.,Negative,,
"I bought an airline ticket through my travel agency. The Biman Air representative refused to accept the confirmation after I arrived at the airport. Two months after buying a new ticket, nobody at the airline has even acknowledged the requests for refunds from me or my travel agent. Customer service is ridiculous.",Negative,,
"I had a bad experience with Airlines. He insulted me and my son and then made a joke out of it. The staff was laughing at us. How can you do that? These people don't care about disabled people. Biplop ruined my family's journey. We were intimidated and didn't feel comfortable. We hunted to get us out. It is forbidden for anyone to go through what we did. People who are evil have no feelings or heart. Hope the people laughed at us. What a name, this is the Culprit Biplop.",Negative,,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines is concerned with service and safety. The weather on my flight was bad. We were taken to the plane by bus. The bus was in a very bad condition and was not an airport bus. Nobody was there to walk us to the plane after we were dropped on the active runway. The plane was in bad shape. I had to hold the back of my seat as it fell on the passenger at my back. The entertainment system was malfunctioning. The food was terrible. The milk power provided for tea probably expired. The cabin crews are not responsive. I suggest avoiding this airline if they don't bring better planes and better service.,Negative,,
The flight was delayed for half an hour. In-flight entertainment can't be operated while sitting inside the flight. The snacks were okay on my departure flight from Bangladesh. They served the same snacks when I came back from Kathmandu at 1:00 pm. They serve stupid snacks during lunch. US Bangla and Regent serve lunch.,Negative,,
The flight was delayed from Kolkata because of poor amenities.,Negative,,
I have had one of my worst flight experiences. I have multiple flight experience and traveled a lot. Most of our domestic flights in India and the USA are better than Biman Bangladesh's international flight. I would suggest traveling in Air India or Jet. I think the bus service is better than the flight experience.,Negative,,
"Don't know where to start. The check in is the first thing we should start with. There is no online check in. We had pre- booked seats as a family. When I checked in at the heathrow counter, they put three of us in three different seats and said because of some regulation they have to put as many passengers towards the rear end as possible, and it's not possible to provide the seats together not even reserved ones. Once the flight reaches cruising altitude, they suggested to talk to crews. They didn't want to understand or listen when they spoke to the crew. The issue had to be dealt with by the captain. The crew members didn't have any customer service skills. There is an old fashioned uniform. The food quality was poor and the menu was fixed. They don't have any vegetarian options to choose from. The seat is not very comfortable. The Biman seats are not as comfortable as the local buses in the UK. 75 percent of in flight entertainment was broken. The 11 hour flight would have been a nightmare if I hadn't taken my kids tablets. Kids can get through the hot screen on the backside. The temperature within the Biman was either too hot or too cold. Before taking off, they don't switch on the aircon. The kids are being bitten by mosquitoes. They might have arrived on the flight from Bangladesh. After 16 years in Biman, I am a frequent flyer. This is probably the last time I will travel with Biman. The price of the tickets does not reflect the service they provide. They are not cheap compared to other airlines.",Negative,,
